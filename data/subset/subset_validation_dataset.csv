The Oxfam shop Swansea receiving average one copy Dan Brown novel week months, leaving little room books. Staff struggling sell copies book put note store saying would rather donors hand vinyl instead.","– The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies—that would be at least 80 million—that it's bound to turn up in book donation piles. But at one charity shop in the UK, it's been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of Da Vinci Code copies that reads: ""You could give us another Da Vinci Code... but we would rather have your vinyl!"" The manager of the Oxfam shop in Swansea tells the Telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display: ""I would say that we get one copy of the book every day."" He says people buy them ""occasionally,"" but with vinyl sales up 25% in the past year, they'd rather take records. Dan Brown's book isn't the only one that shops like Oxfam struggle to re-sell. Last year, Oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of Fifty Shades of Grey, and it similarly begged donors: ""Please—no more."" But Brown has a particular kind of staying power. The Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, and within six years Brown had booted John Grisham from the No. 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to Oxfam's 700 shops, reported the Guardian at the time. The Independent in 2012 reported Brown's best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running. (See why Dan Brown took heat from the Philippines.)"

The aides say they were told by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the VA will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to Dec. 2019. Under the Forever GI Bill signed into law by President Trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school's main campus is located. Tanya Ang, vice president of Veterans Education Success, tells the Military Times that the VA's excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn't good enough. ""That could be hundreds of dollars for some students—per month,"" she says. ""If this was a disability benefit, this would never fly."" The issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the VA's outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the Tennessean reports. The agency is still working to process more than 58,000 claims, reports the Star Tribune. The paper's editorial board calls the delays a ""national disgrace."" ""Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they’ve earned,"" they write."

Historians thought reports permanent settlement 20,000 Native Americans exaggerated. But Arkansas City, confluence Walnut Arkansas Rivers, Blakeslee, anthropologist archaeologist Wichita State University, found evidence massive town stretching across thousands acres bluffs rich bottomland along two rivers. What clinched discovery, high school kid, half-inch iron cannon ball. He even found still-functional water shrine, depicting communication spirit world, carved limestone boulder Tami Greg Norwood’s backyard. It’s good story, true, Blakeslee said: A lost city, forgotten mythology — story once-great Wichita Nation, decimated European diseases, pushed aside American settlers United States Army. Amazed size With discovery, Arkansas City leaders hoping turn town tourist destination. “We always knew whole bunch Indians living around here, found way many artifacts think otherwise,” said Jay Warren, Arkansas City council member. “But idea Dr. Blakeslee came along big was.” Etzanoa might comparable size Cahokia, Blakeslee said. That alone bring world attention. The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site western Illinois, pyramid Monk’s Mound, biggest Native American urban complex ever built United States. It showcases 14.4-acre mound centerpiece ancient city, along outlines city, enclosed fortress walls filled shrines powerful mythology culture outside St. Louis. Cahokia — remnants largest pre-Columbian settlement north Mexico — attracts 400,000 visitors year, fact gets attention Arkansas Citians. If Etzanoa bigger, “and might been,” rewrite American history, Blakeslee said. “The Spaniards amazed size Etzanoa,” Blakeslee said. “They counted 2,000 houses could hold 10 people each. They said would take two three days walk all.” But four centuries, story big Native American town Kansas made sense historians. When French explorers came 1700s, 100 years Spanish battle, met migratory bands Kanza, Wichita, Pawnee, Kiowa, Cheyenne Apache tribes. So historians read Spanish accounts raised questions: If permanent mega-site named Etzanoa, huge accumulation pottery shards? And tens thousands people go? Twenty thousand, Spaniards estimated 1601, equivalent modern-day Derby, Liberal Hays. And could Plains hunters feed tens thousands day day? Bison dangerous. The Wichita horses hunted foot. And Spanish cannonballs, fired outnumbered terrified Spaniards? The battle For years, Blakeslee, 73, read accounts soldiers served Conquistador Juan de Onate, founding governor colony New Mexico. Onate’s soldiers said fought battle 60 years Coronado, somewhere Great Plains. The battle reports said Onate led 70 soldiers New Mexico found vast town junction two rivers. Warriors outskirts threw dirt air Spanish approached, signaling ready fight. “The Rayados,” Onate called Wichitas — “The striped ones,” way painted tattooed faces. The Spaniards entered town, Wichita fled, thousands evacuating north. Onate sent armed patrols empty town. What soldiers saw unnerved them. They told Onate they’d counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes — clusters homes surrounded cornfields. Nervous size place, turned around. Indians told later settlement extended miles past Spaniards stopped, meaning true population might higher 20,000 Spanish estimate. Onate turned men south — came face face hundreds warriors, firing arrows charging Onate’s small Spanish troop. The attackers Escanxaques, tribe enemy Wichita. They come attack Etzanoa — attacked Spanish. Sixty 70 Spaniards wounded. Their four cannons saved them, clusters iron bullets fired cannon-like shotgun blasts, whistling trees boulders. The Escanxaques, stunned, regrouped rock-lined ravine, charged repeatedly uphill attack finally backing off. Cannonballs confirm It high school kid, Adam Ziegler, made link cinched verification Etzanoa. Blakeslee says artifacts Ziegler found past two years show old stories true, years 1450 1700, least 20,000 ancestors today’s Wichita Nation thrived near Arkansas City. Blakeslee realized confluence Walnut Arkansas rivers could one described Spanish. He found traces houses granaries. He’s walked much Arkansas City saw ravines bluffs fit Spanish accounts. After locals like Hap McCleod told people digging “literally tons” flint tools clay pottery shards generations, Blakeslee dug shards, flint arrowheads, knife blades, hide-scrapers awls. Two years ago found rock-lined ravine McLeod’s backyard matched Spanish account Escanxaques regrouped fire attack. He took metal detector there, along Ziegler, Lawrence Free-State High School freshman. “They couldn’t find anything day,” Ziegler recalled. “Dr. Blakeslee said I could use metal detector. An hour two later, I found little ball, buried four inches deep.” Blakeslee found two Spanish cannonballs. That it, Blakeslee said. The old story true. Tough beyond belief Blakeslee says Wichita wronged fate, disease epidemics war. He’s going try set right can. Smallpox illnesses killed probably tens thousands 1600, said. War relocation forced survivors Oklahoma reservations. The tribe lost culture. The tribe’s last fluent speaker Wichita language, Doris McLemore, died last year. The Wichita organized, cultured — “and tough almost beyond belief,” said. They Wichita cousins Quivira, Rice County, built trade network ancestors Pueblo Indians New Mexico. They strapped 50-pound packages dried meat hides pack dogs, walked 550 miles Pueblos. They’d walk back, bringing home cotton fabric, obsidian turquoise. They horses. The women children likely helped hunt bison, Blakeslee said, forming lines waving hide blankets driving bison toward warriors carrying bows arrows. “Think courage took,” Blakeslee said. They cultivated beans, maize (corn), pumpkin squash. They slaughtered bison meat hides industrial scale. The men likely scouted, walking miles day, shadowing herds. The women used flint hide-scrapers thin bison hides. “From day, probably toughest fists,” Blakeslee said. “You’d never want get fistfight Wichita woman.” Intrigue, concern Modern-day Wichitas number 3,000, based Anadarko, Okla., said Gary McAdams, held several leadership positions Wichita Affiliated Tribes. The Wichita intrigued — concerned — might come next, McAdams said. Blakeslee consulted years, telling he’s found, inviting visit sites Arkansas City 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible pasture grass Rice County. Wichitas helped digs. “We would concern go developing thinking Etzanoa tourist center,” McAdams said. “We supportive respectful endeavor want pursue — would want provide input.” Jay Warren, city council member, says town explore development. Cahokia, Illinois, attracts 400,000 visitors year, mostly striking 100-foot-tall Monk’s Mound looks, it’s located next St. Louis Interstate 70. Arkansas City, contrast, pastureland. But Civil War battlefields don’t Monk’s Mound either, Warren said. “And yet attract thousands visitors great job walking trails signs explain step-by-step going on.” If Arkansas City 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students, archaeologists tourists year, would give city boost, said McLeod, whose backyard Adam Ziegler found cannonball. McLeod runs Etzanoa Conservancy, worked two years polish ideas. “We’re really proud history happened here, want share world,” said. “We’re talking putting together one-day wonder,” Warren said. “We’re looking creating something could great region, 50 years road. We’re talking (Unified School District) 470 could enhance education. And think site could also hands-on field training facility archaeologists world.” They could build interactive visitor center, said. They could build reconstructions grass houses granaries Wichita used. They could employ flint-knappers could show skilled craftsmen made arrowheads knife blades. Etzanoa would beautiful, McLeod said.

It wasn't to be, but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602, they did find something staggering: a ""great settlement"" some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people, an ancestral Wichita Indian town called Etzanoa. But French explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people, sowing confusion among latter-day historians. Donald Blakeslee, an archaeologist with Wichita State University, says he's cleared it all up: Etzanoa did exist, he claims, once thriving where the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers meet in Arkansas City, Kansas. Per a university press release, things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old Spanish documents by the University of California, Berkeley's Cibola Project. Prior translation errors caused ""many archaeological discoveries in the area [to be] misinterpreted,"" per the release. In 2015, Blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a Spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined. And, indeed, a search there turned up small iron cannon balls, reported the Kansas City Star at the time. If Blakeslee is right, the ""long-lost city"" would be second only to Cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric Native American sites, reports the Wichita Eagle. That would be a boon for Arkansas City and its 12,000 residents; some 400,000 flock to the remains of Cahokia, in Illinois, each year. The Kansas House of Representatives thinks Blakeslee is onto something; earlier this month it approved a resolution that formally recognizes Etzanoa based on ""the evidence,"" reports the Courier Traveler. (This man followed a hunch, says he uncovered a lost city.)"

The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients.

Bush’s efforts to protect airplanes, the former president likely would have accused them of not caring about national security, and “Republicans would no doubt be running ads juxtaposing Democrats with Osama bin Laden,” writes Dana Milbank in the Washington Post. But here we are nine years out from 9/11, and it’s the Republicans objecting—“loudly”—to the new TSA procedures. ""National security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama,” he writes in a column that also discusses their opposition to the new arms-control treaty with Russia. Last week on Slate, David Weigel made a similar point: “Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state—of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove—was mistrust.” But we’re now in, Milbank writes, “the post-post-9/11 era ,” and “for Democrats, the opposition's gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. There's no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans' security.”"

But eating many carbohydrates — particularly heavily refined starches found bagels, white pasta crackers — collective waistlines favors. A new study published Annals Internal Medicine adds body evidence cutting back carbs, fat, lead weight loss. Researchers Tulane University tracked two groups dieters one year. The participants ranged age early 20s mid-70s included mix African-Americans Caucasians. The low-carb group, reduced carb consumption 28 percent daily calories, lost almost three times much weight low-fat dieters got 40 45 percent calories carbs. The low-fat group lost 4 pounds, whereas low-carb group's average weight loss almost 12 pounds. Participants two groups eating amount calories. The study showed modest reductions carbohydrate consumption, 28 30 percent diet, could help tip scales weight loss. The makeup low-carb group's diet was: 28 percent carbs 40 43 percent fat (twice much poly monounsaturated compared saturated) 28 percent protein The makeup low-fat group's diet was: 28 percent fat 40 45 percent carbs 28 32 percent protein Lydia Bazzano, one study authors associate professor epidemiology Tulane, says anticipated difference weight loss two groups. But size effect — nearly 8-pound difference weight loss — surprising, says. So, kinds meals low-carb dieters eating? ""Typically morning eating eggs,"" says Bazzano. Other breakfast items included small portions high-protein, high-fiber bread, either butter kinds oily spread. As lunch dinner, low-carb dieters ate lots vegetables, salads protein, including fish, chicken red meat. They generous portions healthy fats olive oils, canola plant-based oils. Fat accounted sizable part diet: 40 percent 43 percent total daily calories, including 12 percent saturated fat. Bazzano says many people still abiding low-fat recommendations, diet high fat might sound like good weight-loss strategy. ""It's general perception,"" says. But, fact, spate studies come conclusion benefits swapping low-fat, high-carb strategy pattern eating emphasizes healthy fats lower carbohydrate consumption. It's waistlines respond. The low-carb, healthy fats approach shown cut risk heart disease. One big study published New England Journal Medicine found Mediterranean diet rich olive oil cut risk heart attacks strokes 30 percent, compared low-fat diet. Research published last year Journal American Medical Association, compared low-glycemic-index diet — minimizes refined starches — traditional low-fat diet, also documented advantages. ""We saw improvements triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, possibility lower chronic inflammation"" among lower carb group, JAMA study author David Ludwig Harvard Medical School Boston Children's Hospital told us. Here's fascinating part: Ludwig also found people stopped eating many refined carbohydrates, burned 150 calories per day, compared eating higher carb, lower fat diet. ""Too much refined carbohydrates — white bread, white rice, potato products — foods crept diets we've followed low-fat craze undermined metabolism,"" says Ludwig. In words, high-carb, low-fat pattern eating ""caused us become hungrier burn fewer calories,"" says. What's happening body follow pattern eating still subject much research, Ludwig says thinking goes like this: Eating many carbs overstimulate release insulin direct calories storage fat cells. ""It's double-whammy weight gain,"" Ludwig says. ""We've told decades want fat body, put fat body. It's appealing notion, problem wrong."" ||||| A low-carbohydrate diet better losing weight may also better lowering risk heart disease low-fat diet, according new study. While low-carb diets outperformed diets comes weight loss, researchers feared might worse heart health tend high fat. The new study shows proper nutritional counseling, people lose weight lower risk factors heart disease low-carbohydrate diet, said lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano Tulane University New Orleans. ""This study shows overweight cardiovascular disease risk factors success diets, certainly low-carbohydrate diet worth try,"" said Bazzano. Carbohydrates found food include sugar, fiber starches give body energy. Some carbs - like whole grains fruits - healthier others - like white bread processed foods. Bazzano colleagues write Annals Internal Medicine low-carb diets become popular weight loss strategies recent years. Studies effects cardiovascular risk factors produced mixed results, however. For new study, colleagues recruited 148 obese men women ages 22 75. None participants heart disease diabetes. Half randomly assigned follow low-carbohydrate diet year, half assigned low-fat diet year. They told change physical activity throughout trial. All participants attended regular meetings learned portion control, healthy eating overall nutrition. They also offered one meal-replacement bar shake per day. The difference groups proportions carbohydrate fat diets. Those low-carbohydrate group told eat 40 grams digestible carbohydrates per day. (""Digestible carbs"" equals total carbs minus total fiber.) Those low-fat group told get 30 percent daily energy fat 55 percent daily energy carbohydrates. Overall, four every five participants still following diets 12 months later. During time, researchers found, people low-carbohydrate diet lost weight body fat low-fat diet. The difference lost weight two groups would represent eight additional pounds. Additionally, researchers saw increases total cholesterol ""bad"" LDL cholesterol two groups. Bazzano said that's good news since thought low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels. Those low-carbohydrate group lower levels fat circulating blood lower scores measure often used predict risk heart attack stroke within next 10 years. ""I thought striking finding,"" Bazzano said. She added score predicts risk future heart attacks strokes computed study finished less reliable risk factors measured. Dr. David Jenkins, involved study, told Reuters Health, ""This doesn’t look say 'eat meats want lower carbohydrates.' That’s one way it."" Instead, Jenkins said, people study appeared improve overall diets. For example, eating foods healthier fats, nuts beans. He also said seemed eat fiber cut processed foods carbohydrates. ""I think it’s another testament one plant-based diet using right macronutrient profile,"" said Jenkins Department Nutritional Sciences University Toronto Keenan Research Centre St. Michael's Hospital. Bazzano agreed overall diets improved among participants encouraged eat healthier forms protein like chicken, fish, nuts beans. She also said team sure people low-carbohydrate diets lost weight lower risk factors heart disease one year. It's clear, added,if would still difference longer period. SOURCE: bit.ly/1qjI8OG Annals Internal Medicine, online September 1, 2014.","– If you're trying to lose weight on a low-fat diet and it's not working, here's why. Refined carbohydrates—found in processed foods like white breads, white rice, and pastas—tend to be loaded with sugar, which messes with our metabolisms, making it harder to burn calories. Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand—think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils—has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. ""It's a double-whammy for weight gain,"" one researcher tells NPR. ""We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong."" What's more, the researchers say there was no increase in total or bad cholesterol between the groups, which has been feared would be the case in higher-fat diets, reports Reuters. It remains unclear precisely why people on lower-carb diets not only lost more weight but had lower heart disease risk factors. It's something the researchers say will need to be studied more and for longer than the one-year period of this investigation.

Every time the show got moving, a tribute cast a pall over the proceedings."" The opening sketch was ""dreary,"" the first onstage piece ""tiresome,"" and the whole thing ""anemic and often awkward,"" writes Hank Stuever in the Washington Post. All the jokes seemed to be about the show itself, and then there were the bits that were included because ... why? No one seems to know (think the aforementioned Carrie Underwood performance). ""So, to sum up: An awards show filled with skits about how bad awards shows are gave awards to people who talked about how bad the show turned out, while everyone on Twitter had decided that hours earlier."" There were lots of unexpected wins, but even so, the whole thing was ""a bloated bore,"" writes David Rooney in the Hollywood Reporter. The ""overload of solemnity"" and ""self-important sobriety"" was part of the problem, but the ""labored filler segments"" were also pretty bad—especially considering they were the reason the ""award recipients were played off virtually as soon as they began speaking."" Even a long-overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad couldn't save this ""plodding, lifeless, and just plain glum"" show.

Interestingly, a University of Michigan survey of some 2,000 people over 25, published in March, found heterosexuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied with their relationship overall than those in monogamous relationships, reported Michigan Live. On the flip side, though, those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts.

"2015-12-10 Vatican Radio (Vatican Radio) The Vatican’s Commission Religious Relations Jews released new document exploring unresolved theological questions heart Christian-Jewish dialogue. The new document, entitled ‘The Gifts Calling God irrevocable’, marks 50th anniversary ground-breaking declaration ‘Nostra Aetate’. It presented press conference Vatican Thursday, Cardinal Kurt Koch, Fr Norbert Hofmann Vatican Commission, together two Jewish representatives, Rabbi David Rosen, International Director Interreligious Affairs American Jewish Committee, Dr Ed Kessler, founding director Cambridge Woolf Institute.

The universality salvation Jesus Christ God’s unrevoked covenant Israel The Church’s mandate evangelize relation Judaism The goals dialogue Judaism PREFACE Fifty years ago, declaration “Nostra aetate ” Second Vatican Council promulgated. Its fourth article presents relationship Catholic Church Jewish people new theological framework. The following reflections aim looking back gratitude achieved last decades Jewish-Catholic relationship, providing time new stimulus future. Stressing unique status relationship within wider ambit interreligious dialogue, theological questions discussed, relevance revelation, relationship Old New Covenant, relationship universality salvation Jesus Christ affirmation covenant God Israel never revoked, Church’s mandate evangelize relation Judaism. This document presents Catholic reflections questions, placing theological context, order significance may deepened members faith traditions. The text magisterial document doctrinal teaching Catholic Church, reflection prepared Commission Religious Relations Jews current theological questions developed since Second Vatican Council. It intended starting point theological thought view enriching intensifying theological dimension Jewish-Catholic dialogue. 1. A brief history impact “Nostra aetate” (No.4) last 50 years “Nostra aetate” (No.4) rightly counted among documents Second Vatican Council able effect, particularly striking manner, new direction Catholic Church since then. This shift relations Church Jewish people Judaism becomes apparent recall previously great reservations sides, part history Christianity seen discriminatory Jews, even including attempts forced conversion (cf. “Evangelii gaudium”, 248). The background complex connection consists inter alia asymmetrical relationship: minority Jews often confronted dependent upon Christian majority. The dark terrible shadow Shoah Europe Nazi period led Church reflect anew bond Jewish people. The fundamental esteem Judaism expressed “Nostra aetate” (No.4) however enabled communities faced one another scepticism become - step step years - reliable partners even good friends, capable weathering crises together negotiating conflicts positively. Therefore, fourth article “Nostra aetate” recognised solid foundation improving relationship Catholics Jews. For practical implementation “Nostra aetate” (No.4), Blessed Pope Paul VI 22 October 1974 established Commission Religious Relations Jews which, although organisationally attached Pontifical Council Promoting Christian Unity, operationally independent entrusted task accompanying fostering religious dialogue Judaism. From theological perspective also makes good sense link Commission Council Promoting Christian Unity, since separation Synagogue Church may viewed first far-reaching breach among chosen people. Within year foundation, Holy See’s Commission published first official document 1 December 1974, title “Guidelines Suggestions Implementing Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate (No.4)”. The crucial new concern document consists becoming acquainted Judaism defines itself, giving expression high esteem Christianity holds Judaism stressing great significance Catholic Church dialogue Jews, stated words document: “On practical level particular, Christians must therefore strive acquire better knowledge basic components religious tradition Judaism: must strive learn essential traits Jews define light religious experience” (Preamble). On basis Church’s witness faith Jesus Christ, document reflects upon specific nature Church’s dialogue Judaism. Reference made text roots Christian liturgy Jewish matrix, new possibilities outlined rapprochement spheres teaching, education training, finally suggestions made joint social action. Eleven years later 24 June 1985, Holy See’s Commission issued second document entitled “Notes correct way present Jews Judaism preaching catechesis Roman Catholic Church”. This document stronger theolo gical- exegetical orientation insofar reflects relationship Old New Testaments, delineates Jewish roots Christian faith, explicates manner ‘the Jews’ represented New Testament, points commonalities liturgy, great festivals church year, briefly focuses relationship Judaism Christianity history. With regard “land forefathers” document emphasizes: “Christians invited understand religious attachment finds roots Biblical tradition, without however making particular religious interpretation relationship. ... The existence State Israel political options envisaged perspective religious, reference common principles international law.” The permanence Israel however perceived “historic fact sign interpreted within God’s design” (VI, 1). A third document Commission Religious Relations Jews presented public 16 March 1998. It deals Shoah title “We remember. A reflection Shoah”. This text delivers harsh accurate judgement balance 2000-year relationship Jews Christians regrettably negative. It recalls attitude Christians towards anti-Semitism National Socialists focuses duty Christians remember human catastrophe Shoah. In letter beginning declaration Saint Pope John Paul II expresses hope document truly “help heal wounds past misunderstandings injustices. May enable memory play necessary part process shaping future unspeakable iniquity Shoah never possible.” In series documents issued Holy See, reference must made text published Pontifical Biblical Commission 24 May 2001, deals explicitly Jewish-Catholic dialogue: “The Jewish People Sacred Scriptures Christian Bible”. This represents significant exegetical theological document Jewish-Catholic dialogue treasure-trove common issues basis Scriptures Judaism Christianity. The Sacred Scriptures Jewish people considered “fundamental component Christian Bible”, fundamental themes Holy Scripture Jewish people adoption faith Christ discussed, manner Jews represented New Testament illustrated detail. Texts documents, important are, cannot replace personal encounters face-to-face dialogues. While Blessed Pope Paul VI first steps Jewish- Catholic dialogue undertaken, Saint Pope John Paul II succeeded fostering deepening dialogue compelling gestures towards Jewish people. He first pope visit former concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau pray victims Shoah, visited Roman Synagogue express solidarity Jewish community. In context historical pilgrimage Holy Land, also guest state Israel participated interreligious encounters, paid visit Chief Rabbis prayed Western Wall. Again met Jewish groups, whether Vatican numerous apostolic journeys. So Benedict XVI, even election papacy, engaged Jewish-Catholic dialogue offering series lectures important theological reflections relationship Old New Covenant, Synagogue Church. Following election footsteps Saint Pope John Paul II fostered dialogue way reinforcing gestures giving expression esteem Judaism power words. As Archbishop Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio greatly committed fostering Jewish-Catholic dialogue many friends among Jews Argentina. Now Pope continues, international level, intensify dialogue Judaism many friendly encounters. One first encounters May 2014 Israel, met two Chief Rabbis, visited Western Wall, prayed victims Shoah Yad Vashem. Even establishment Holy See’s Commission, contacts links various Jewish organisations Secretariat Promoting Christian Unity. Since Judaism multi-facetted constituted organisational unity, Catholic Church faced challenge determining engage, possible conduct individual independent bilateral dialogues Jewish groupings organisations declared readiness dialogue. To resolve problem Jewish organisations took suggestion Catholic Church establish single organisation dialogue. The International Jewish Committee Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) official Jewish representative Holy See’s Commission Religious Relations Jews. The IJCIC began work 1970, year later first joint conference organized Paris. The conferences conducted regularly since responsibility entity known International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC), shape collaboration IJCIC Holy See’s Commission. In February 2011, Paris, ILC able look back gratitude 40 years institutional dialogue. Much developed past 40 years; former confrontation turned successful cooperation, previous potential conflict become positive conflict management, past co-existence marked tension replaced resilient fruitful mutuality. The bonds friendship forged meantime proved stable, become possible address even controversial subjects together without danger permanent damage done dialogue. This necessary past decades dialogue always free tensions. In general, however, one observe appreciation Jewish-Catholic dialogue since new millennium all, intensive efforts made deal openly positively arising differences opinion conflicts, way mutual relations become stronger. Beside dialogue IJCIC also mention institutional conversation Chief Rabbinate Israel, clearly seen fruit encounter Saint Pope John Paul II Chief Rabbis Jerusalem visit Israel March 2000. The first meeting organised June 2002 Jerusalem, since meetings conducted annually, taking place Rome Jerusalem alternately. The two delegations relatively small personal intensive discussion various subjects possible, sanctity life, status family, significance Sacred Scriptures life society, religious freedom, ethical foundations human behaviour, ecological challenge, relationship secular religious authority essential qualities religious leadership secular society. The fact Catholic representatives taking part meetings bishops priests Jewish representatives almost exclusively rabbis permits individual topics examined religious perspective well. The dialogue Chief Rabbinate Israel extent enabled open relations Orthodox Judaism Catholic Church global level. After meeting joint declaration published instance testified richness common spiritual heritage Judaism Christianity valuable treasures still unearthed. In reviewing ten years dialogue gratefully affirm strong friendship resulted represents firm foundation future. The efforts Holy See’s Commission Religious Relations Jews cannot course restricted two institutional dialogues. The Commission aims fact open streams within Judaism maintaining contact Jewish groupings organisations wish establish links Holy See. The Jewish side shows particular interest audiences Pope, every instance prepared Commission. Besides direct contacts Judaism Holy See’s Commission also strives provide opportunities within Catholic Church dialogue Judaism work together individual Bishops’ Conferences support locally promoting Jewish-Catholic dialogue. The introduction ‘Day Judaism’ European countries good example this. Over past decades ‘dialogue ad extra’ ‘dialogue ad intra’ led increasing clarity awareness Christians Jews irrevocably inter­dependent, dialogue two matter choice duty far theology concerned. Jews Christians enrich one another mutual friendship. Without Jewish roots Church would danger losing soteriological anchoring salvation history would slide ultimately unhistorical Gnosis. Pope Francis states “while true certain Christian beliefs unacceptable Judaism, Church cannot refrain proclaiming Jesus Lord Messiah, exists well rich complementarity allows us read texts Hebrew Scriptures together help one another mine riches God’s word. We also share many ethical convictions common concern justice development peoples” (“Evangelii gaudium”, 249). The special theological status Jewish-Catholic dialogue The dialogue Judaism Christians something quite special, since Christianity possesses Jewish roots determine relations two unique way (cf. “Evangelii gaudium”, 247). In spite historical breach painful conflicts arising it, Church remains conscious enduring continuity Israel. Judaism considered simply another religion; Jews instead “elder brothers” (Saint Pope John Paul II), “fathers faith” (Benedict XVI). Jesus Jew, home Jewish tradition time, decisively shaped religious milieu (cf. “Ecclesia Medio Oriente”, 20). His first disciples gathered around heritage defined Jewish tradition everyday life. In unique relationship heavenly Father, Jesus intent proclaiming coming Kingdom God. “The time fulfilled kingdom God hand, repent believe gospel” (Mk 1:15). Within Judaism many different kinds ideas regarding kingdom God would realised, yet Jesus’ central message Kingdom God accordance Jewish thinking day. One cannot understand Jesus’ teaching disciples without situating within Jewish horizon context living tradition Israel; one would understand teachings even less seen opposition tradition. In Jesus Jews time saw coming ‘new Moses’, promised Christ (Messiah). But coming nevertheless provoked drama consequences still felt today. Fully completely human, Jew time, descendant Abraham, son David, shaped whole tradition Israel, heir prophets, Jesus stands continuity people history. On hand is, light Christian faith, God - Son - transcends time, history, every earthly reality. The community believe confesses divinity (cf. Phil 2:6-11). In sense perceived discontinuity history prepared coming. From perspective Christian faith, fulfils mission expectation Israel perfect way. At time, however, overcomes transcends eschatological manner. Herein consists fundamental difference Judaism Christianity, is, figure Jesus evaluated. Jews able see Jesus belonging people, Jewish teacher felt called particular way preach Kingdom God. That Kingdom God come God’s representative beyond horizon Jewish expectation. The conflict Jesus Jewish authorities time ultimately matter individual transgression law, Jesus’ claim acting divine authority. The figure Jesus thus remains Jews ‘stumbling block’, central neuralgic point Jewish-Catholic dialogue. From theological perspective, Christians need refer Judaism Jesus’ time degree also Judaism developed ages self-understanding. Given Jesus’ Jewish origins, coming terms Judaism one way another indispensable Christians. Yet, history relationship Judaism Christianity also mutually influenced time. Dialogue Jews Christians termed ‘interreligious dialogue’ analogy, is, dialogue two intrinsically separate different religions. It case two fundamentally diverse religions confront one another developed independently one another without mutual influence. The soil nurtured Jews Christians Judaism Jesus’ time, brought forth Christianity also, destruction temple year 70, post-biblical rabbinical Judaism without sacrificial cult and, development, depend exclusively prayer interpretation written oral divine revelation. Thus Jews Christians mother seen, were, two siblings - normal course events siblings - developed different directions. The Scriptures ancient Israel constitute integral part Scriptures Judaism Christianity, understood word God, revelation, salvation history. The first Christians Jews; matter course gathered part community Synagogue, observed dietary laws, Sabbath requirement circumcision, time confessing Jesus Christ, Messiah sent God salvation Israel entire human race. With Paul ‘Jewish Jesus movement’ definitively opens horizons transcends purely Jewish origins. Gradually concept came prevail, is, non-Jew become first Jew order confess Christ. In early years Church, therefore, so-called Jewish Christians Gentile Christians, ecclesia ex circumcisione ecclesia ex gentibus, one Church originating Judaism, Gentiles, however together constituted one Church Jesus Christ. The separation Church Synagogue take place abruptly however and, according recent insights, may complete well third fourth centuries. This means many Jewish Christians first period perceive contradiction living accordance aspects Jewish tradition yet confessing Jesus Christ. Only number Gentile Christians represented majority, within Jewish community polemics regarding figure Jesus took sharper contours, definitive separation appear longer avoidable. Over time siblings Christianity Judaism increasingly grew apart, becoming hostile even defaming one another. For Christians, Jews often represented damned God blind since unable recognise Jesus Messiah bearer salvation. For Jews, Christians often seen heretics longer followed path originally laid God went way. It without reason Acts Apostles Christianity called ‘the way’ (cf. Acts 9:2; 19:9,23; 24:14,22) contrast Jewish Halacha determined interpretation law practical conduct. Over time Judaism Christianity became increasingly alienated one another, even becoming involved ruthless conflicts accusing one another abandoning path prescribed God. On part many Church Fathers so-called replacement theory supersessionism steadily gained favour Middle Ages represented standard theological foundation relationship Judaism: promises commitments God would longer apply Israel recognised Jesus Messiah Son God, transferred Church Jesus Christ true ‘new Israel’, new chosen people God. Arising soil, Judaism Christianity centuries separation became involved theological antagonism defused Second Vatican Council. With Declaration “Nostra aetate” (No.4) Church unequivocally professes, within new theological framework, Jewish roots Christianity. While affirming salvation explicit even implicit faith Christ, Church question continued love God chosen people Israel. A replacement supersession theology sets one another two separate entities, Church Gentiles rejected Synagogue whose place takes, deprived foundations. From originally close relationship Judaism Christianity long-term state tension developed, gradually transformed Second Vatican Council constructive dialogue relationship. There often attempts identify replacement theory Epistle Hebrews. This Epistle, however, directed Jews rather Christians Jewish background become weary uncertain. Its purpose strengthen faith encourage persevere, pointing Christ Jesus true ultimate high priest, mediator new covenant. This context necessary understand Epistle’s contrast first purely earthly covenant second better (cf. Heb 8:7) new covenant (cf. 9:15, 12:24). The first covenant defined outdated, decline doomed obsolescence (cf. 8:13), second covenant defined everlasting (cf. 13:20). To establish foundations contrast Epistle refers promise new covenant Book Prophet Jeremiah 31:31-34 (cf. Heb 8:8-12). This demonstrates Epistle Hebrews intention proving promises Old Covenant false, contrary treats valid. The reference Old Testament promises intended help Christians sure salvation Christ. At issue Epistle Hebrews contrast Old New Covenants understand today, contrast church Judaism. Rather, contrast eternal heavenly priesthood Christ transitory earthly priesthood. The fundamental issue Epistle Hebrews new situation Christological interpretation New Covenant. For exactly reason, “Nostra aetate” (No.4) refer Epistle Hebrews, rather Saint Paul’s reflections letter Romans 9-11. For outside observer, Conciliar Declaration “Nostra aetate” could give impression text deals relations Catholic Church world religions relationship based parity, history development text point different direction. Originally Saint Pope John XXIII proposed Council promulgate Tractatus de Iudaeis, end decision made give consideration world religions “Nostra aetate”. However, fourth article Conciliar Declaration, deals new theological relationship Judaism, represents almost heart document, place also made Catholic Church’s relationship religions. The relationship Judaism sense seen catalyst determination relationship world religions. Nevertheless, theological perspective dialogue Judaism completely different character different level comparison world religions. The faith Jews testified Bible, found Old Testament, Christians another religion foundation faith, although clearly figure Jesus sole key Christian interpretation Scriptures Old Testament. The cornerstone Christian faith Jesus (cf. Acts 4:11; 1 Pt 2:4-8). However, dialogue Judaism occupies unique position Christians; Christianity roots connected Judaism religion. Therefore Jewish-Christian dialogue reservations termed ‘interreligious dialogue’ true sense expression; one could however speak kind ‘intra-religious’ ‘intra-familial’ dialogue sui generis. In address Roman Synagogue 13 April 1986 Saint Pope John Paul II expressed situation words: “The Jewish religion ‘extrinsic’ us certain way ‘intrinsic’ religion. With Judaism therefore relationship religion. You dearly beloved brothers and, certain way, could said elder brothers.” Revelation history ‘Word God’ Judaism Christianity We find Old Testament God’s plan salvation presented people (cf. “Dei verbum”, 14). This plan salvation expressed enlightening way beginning biblical history call Abraham (Gen 12ff). In order reveal speak humankind, redeeming sin gathering together one people, God began choosing people Israel Abraham setting apart. To God revealed gradually emissaries, prophets, true God, God, living God, redeeming God. This divine election constitutive people Israel. Only first great intervention redeeming God, liberation slavery Egypt (cf. Ex 13:17ff) establishment covenant Sinai (Ex 19ff), twelve tribes truly become nation become conscious people God, bearers message promises, witnesses merciful favour midst nations also nations (cf. Is 26:1-9; 54; 60; 62). In order instruct people fulfil mission pass revelation entrusted them, God gave Israel law defines live (cf. Ex 20; Deut 5), distinguishes peoples. Like Church even day, Israel bears treasure election fragile vessels. The relationship Israel Lord story faithfulness unfaithfulness. In order fulfil work salvation despite smallness weakness instruments chose, God manifested mercy graciousness gifts, well faithfulness promises human infidelity nullify (cf. Rom 3:3; 2 Tim 2:13). At every step people along way God set apart least ‘small number’ (cf. Deut 4:27), ‘remnant’ (cf. Is 1:9; Zeph 3:12; cf. also Is 6:13; 17:5-6), handful faithful ‘have bowed knee Baal’ (cf. 1 Kings 19:18). Through remnant, God realized plan salvation. Constantly object election love remained chosen people - ultimate goal - whole humanity gathered together led him. The Church called new people God (cf. “Nostra aetate”, No.4) sense people God Israel ceased exist. The Church “was prepared remarkable way throughout history people Israel means Old Covenant” (“Lumen gentium”, 2). The Church replace people God Israel, since community founded Christ represents fulfilment promises made Israel. This mean Israel, achieved fulfilment, longer considered people God. “Although Church new people God, Jews presented rejected accursed God, followed Holy Scriptures” (“Nostra aetate”, No.4). God revealed Word, may understood humanity actual historical situations. This Word invites people respond. If responses accord Word God stand right relationship him. For Jews Word learned Torah traditions based it. The Torah instruction successful life right relationship God. Whoever observes Torah life fullness (cf. Pirqe Avot II, 7). By observing Torah Jew receives share communion God. In regard, Pope Francis stated: “The Christian confessions find unity Christ; Judaism finds unity Torah. Christians believe Jesus Christ Word God made flesh world; Jews Word God present Torah. Both faith traditions find foundation One God, God Covenant, reveals Word. In seeking right attitude towards God, Christians turn Christ fount new life, Jews teaching Torah.” (Address mbers International Council Christians Jews, 30 June 2015). Judaism Christian faith seen New Testament two ways God’s people make Sacred Scriptures Israel own. The Scriptures Christians call Old Testament open therefore ways. A response God’s word salvation accords one tradition thus open access God, even left counsel salvation determine way may intend save mankind instance. That salvation universally directed testified Scriptures (cf. eg. Gen 12:1-3; Is 2:2-5; 1 Tim 2:4). Therefore two paths salvation according expression “Jews hold Torah, Christians hold Christ”. Christian faith proclaims Christ’s work salvation universal involves mankind. God’s word one single undivided reality takes concrete form respective historical context. In sense, Christians affirm Jesus Christ considered ‘the living Torah God’. Torah Christ Word God, revelation us human beings testimony boundless love. For Christians, pre-existence Christ Word Son Father fundamental doctrine, according rabbinical tradition Torah name Messiah exist already creation (cf. Genesis Rabbah 1,1). Further, according Jewish understanding God interprets Torah Eschaton, Christian understanding everything recapitulated Christ end (cf. Eph 1:10; Col 1:20). In gospel Matthew Christ seen ‘new Moses’. Matthew 5:17-19 presents Jesus authoritative authentic interpreter Torah (cf. Lk 24:27, 45-47). In rabbinical literature, however, find identification Torah Moses. Against background, Christ ‘new Moses’ connected Torah. Torah Christ locus presence God world presence experienced respective worship communities. The Hebrew dabar means word event time - thus one may reach conclusion word Torah may open Christ event. 4. The relationship Old New Testament Old New Covenant The covenant God offered Israel irrevocable. “God man, lie” (Num 23:19; cf. 2 Tim 2:13). The permanent elective fidelity God expressed earlier covenants never repudiated (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:1-2). The New Covenant revoke earlier covenants, brings fulfilment. Through Christ event Christians understood gone interpreted anew. For Christians New Covenant acquired quality own, even though orientation consists unique relationship God (cf. example, covenant formula Lev 26:12, “I God people”). For Christians, New Covenant Christ culminating point promises salvation Old Covenant, extent never independent it. The New Covenant grounded based Old, ultimately God Israel concludes Old Covenant people Israel enables New Covenant Jesus Christ. Jesus lives period Old Covenant, work salvation New Covenant confirms perfects dimensions Old. The term covenant, therefore, means relationship God takes effect different ways Jews Christians. The New Covenant never replace Old presupposes gives new dimension meaning, reinforcing personal nature God revealed Old Covenant establishing openness respond faithfully nations (cf. Zech 8:20-23; Psalm 87). Unity difference Judaism Christianity come fore first instance testimonies divine revelation. With existence Old Testament integral part one Christian Bible, deeply rooted sense intrinsic kinship Judaism Christianity. The roots Christianity lie Old Testament, Christianity constantly draws nourishment roots. However, Christianity grounded person Jesus Nazareth, recognised Messiah promised Jewish people, begotten Son God communicated Holy Spirit following death cross resurrection. With existence New Testament, question naturally arose quite soon two testaments related one another, whether example New Testament writings superseded older writings nullified them. This position represented Marcion, second century held New Testament made Old Testament book promises obsolete, destined fade away glow new, one longer needs light moon soon sun risen. This stark antithesis Hebrew Christian Bible never became official doctrine Christian Church. By excluding Marcion Christian community 144, Church rejected concept purely “Christian” Bible purged Old Testament elements, bore witness faith one God author testaments, thus held fast unity testaments, “concordia testamentorum”. This course one side relationship two testaments. The common patrimony Old Testament formed fundamental basis spiritual kinship Jews Christians also brought basic tension relationship two faith communities. This demonstrated fact Christians read Old Testament light New, conviction expressed Augustine indelible formula: “In Old Testament New concealed New Old revealed” (Quaestiones Heptateuchum 2, 73). Pope Gregory Great also spoke sense defined Old Testament “the prophecy New” latter “best exposition Old” (Homiliae Ezechielem I, VI, 15; cf. “Dei verbum”, 16). This Christological exegesis easily give rise impression Christians consider New Testament fulfilment Old time replacement it. That impression cannot correct evident already fact Judaism found compelled adopt new reading Scripture catastrophe destruction Second Temple year 70. Since Sadducees bound temple survive catastrophe, rabbis, following footsteps Pharisees, already developed particular mode reading interpreting Scripture, without temple centre Jewish religious devotion. As consequence two responses situation, precisely, two new ways reading Scripture, namely Christological exegesis Christians rabbinical exegesis form Judaism developed historically. Since mode involved new interpretation Scripture, crucial new question must precisely two modes related other. But since Christian Church post-biblical rabbinical Judaism developed parallel, also opposition mutual ignorance, question cannot answered New Testament alone. After centuries opposing positions duty Jewish-Catholic dialogue bring two new ways reading Biblical writings dialogue one another order perceive “rich complementarity” exists “to help one another mine riches God’s word” (“Evangelii gaudium”, 249). The document Pontifical Biblical Commission “The Jewish People Their Sacred Scriptures Christian Bible” 2001 therefore stated Christians must admit “that Jewish reading Bib le possible one, continuity Jewish Scriptures Second Temple period, reading analogous Christian reading developed parallel fashion”. It draws conclusion: “Both readings bound vision respective faiths, readings result expression. Consequently, irreducible” (No.22). Since two readings serves purpose rightly understanding God’s word, becomes evident important awareness Christian faith rooted faith Abraham. That raises question Old New Covenant stand relation one another. For Christian faith axiomatic one single covenant history God humanity. The covenant Abraham, circumcision sign (cf. Gen 17), covenant Moses restricted Israel regarding obedience law (cf. Ex 19:5; 24:7-8) particular observance Sabbath (cf. Ex 31:16-17) extended covenant Noah, rainbow sign (cf. “Verbum Domini”, 117), whole creation (cf. Gen 9:9 ff). Through prophets God turn promises new eternal covenant (cf. Is 55:3; 61:8; Jer 31:31-34; Ez 36:22-28). Each covenants incorporates previous covenant interprets new way. That also true New Covenant Christians final eternal covenant therefore definitive interpretation promised prophets Old Covenant, Paul expresses it, “Yes” “Amen” “all God promised” (2 Cor 1:20). The Church renewed people God elected God without conditions. The Church definitive unsurpassable locus salvific action God. This however mean Israel people God repudiated lost mission (cf. “Nostra aetate”, No.4). The New Covenant Christians therefore neither annulment replacement, fulfilment promises Old Covenant. For Jewish-Christian dialogue first instance God’s covenant Abraham proves constitutive, father Israel also father faith Christians. In covenant community evident Christians covenant God concluded Israel never revoked remains valid basis God’s unfailing faithfulness people, consequently New Covenant Christians believe understood affirmation fulfilment Old. Christians therefore also convinced New Covenant Abrahamic covenant obtained universality peoples originally intended call Abram (cf. Gen 12:1-3). This recourse Abrahamic covenant essentially constitutive Christian faith Church without Israel would danger losing locus history salvation. By token, Jews could regard Abrahamic covenant arrive insight Israel without Church would danger remaining particularist failing grasp universality experience God. In fundamental sense Israel Church remain bound according covenant interdependent. That one history God’s covenant mankind, consequently Israel God’s chosen beloved people covenant never repealed revoked (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:29), conviction behind Apostle Paul’s passionate struggle dual fact Old Covenant God continues force, Israel adopted New Covenant. In order justice facts Paul coined expressive image root Israel wild branches Gentiles grafted (cf. Rom 11:16-21). One could say Jesus Christ bears living root “green olive tree”, yet deeper meaning whole promise root (cf. Jn 8:58). This image represents Paul decisive key thinking relationship Israel Church light faith. With image Paul gives expression duality unity divergence Israel Church. On one hand image taken seriously sense grafted wild branches origin branches plant onto grafted new situation represents new reality new dimension God’s work salvation, Christian Church cannot merely understood branch fruit Israel (cf. Mt 8:10­13). On hand, image also taken seriously sense Church draws nourishment strength root Israel, grafted branches would wither even die cut root Israel (cf. “Ecclesia Medio Oriente”, 21). 5. The universality salvation Jesus Christ God’s unrevoked covenant Israel Since God never revoked covenant people Israel, cannot different paths approaches God’s salvation. The theory may two different paths salvation, Jewish path without Christ path Christ, Christians believe Jesus Nazareth, would fact endanger foundations Christian faith. Confessing universal therefore also exclusive mediation salvation Jesus Christ belongs core Christian faith. So confession one God, God Israel, revelation Jesus Christ become totally manifest God peoples, insofar promise fulfilled peoples pray God Israel one God (cf. Is 56:1-8). The document “Notes correct way present Jews Judaism preaching catechesis Roman Catholic Church” published Holy See’s Commission Religious Relations Jews 1985 therefore maintained Church Judaism cannot represented “two parallel ways salvation”, Church must “witness Christ Redeemer all” (No.I, 7). The Christian faith confesses God wants lead people salvation, Jesus Christ universal mediator salvation, “other name heaven given human race saved” (Acts 4:12). From Christian confession one path salvation, however, way follow Jews excluded God’s salvation believe Jesus Christ Messiah Israel Son God. Such claim would find support soteriological understanding Saint Paul, Letter Romans gives expression conviction breach history salvation, salvation comes Jews (cf. also Jn 4:22). God entrusted Israel unique mission, He bring mysterious plan salvation peoples (cf. 1 Tim 2:4) fulfilment without drawing “first-born son” (Ex 4:22). From self-evident Paul Letter Romans definitively negates question posed, whether God repudiated people. Just decisively asserts: “For gifts call God irrevocable” (Rom 11:29). That Jews participants God’s salvation theologically unquestionable, possible without confessing Christ explicitly, remains unfathomable divine mystery. It therefore accident Paul’s soteriological reflections Romans 9-11 irrevocable redemption Israel background Christ-mystery culminate magnificent doxology: “Oh, depth riches wisdom knowledge God! How inscrutable judgments unsearchable ways” (Rom 11:33). Bernard Clairvaux (De cons. III/1,3) says Jews “a determined point time fixed cannot anticipated”. Another focus Catholics must continue highly complex theological question Christian belief universal salvific significance Jesus Christ combined coherent way equally clear statement faith never-revoked covenant God Israel. It belief Church Christ Saviour all. There cannot two ways salvation, therefore, since Christ also Redeemer Jews addition Gentiles. Here confront mystery God’s work, matter missionary efforts convert Jews, rather expectation Lord bring hour united, “when peoples call God one voice ‘serve shoulder shoulder’ ” (“Nostra aetate”, No.4). The Declaration Second Vatican Council Judaism, fourth article “Nostra aetate”, located within decidedly theological framework regarding universality salvation Jesus Christ God’s unrevoked covenant Israel. That mean theological questions arise relationship Christianity Judaism resolved text. These questions introduced Declaration, require theological reflection. Of course, earlier magisterial texts focussed Judaism, “Nostra aetate” (No.4) provides first theological overview relationship Catholic Church Jews. Because theological breakthrough, Conciliar text infrequently over-interpreted, things read fact contain. An important example over-interpretation would following: covenant God made people Israel perdures never invalidated. Although statement true, cannot explicitly read “Nostra aetate” (No.4). This statement instead first made full clarity Saint Pope John Paul II said meeting Jewish representatives Mainz 17 November 1980 Old Covenant never bee n revoked God: “The first dimension dialogue, is, meeting people God Old Covenant, never revoked God ... New Covenant, time dialogue within Church, say, first second part Bible” (No.3). The conviction stated also Catechism Church 1993: “The Old Covenant never revoked” (121). The Church’s mandate evangelize relation Judaism It easy understand so-called ‘mission Jews’ delicate sensitive matter Jews because, eyes, involves existence Jewish people. This question also proves awkward Christians, universal salvific significance Jesus Christ consequently universal mission Church fundamental importance. The Church therefore obliged view evangelisation Jews, believe one God, different manner people religions world views. In concrete terms means Catholic Church neither conducts supports specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews. While principled rejection institutional Jewish mission, Christians nonetheless called bear witness faith Jesus Christ also Jews, although humble sensitive manner, acknowledging Jews bearers God’s Word, particularly view great tragedy Shoah. The concept mission must presented correctly dialogue Jews Christians. Christian mission origin sending Jesus Father. He gives disciples share call relation God’s people Israel (cf. Mt 10:6) risen Lord regard nations (cf. Mt 28:19). Thus people God attains new dimension Jesus, calls Church Jews Gentiles (cf. Eph 2:11­22) basis faith Christ means baptism, incorporation Body Church (“Lumen gentium”, 14). Christian mission witness, personal life proclamation, belong together. The principle Jesus gives disciples sends suffer violence rather inflict violence. Christians must put trust God, carry universal plan salvation ways knows, witnesses Christ, implement salvation humankind. Zeal “house Lord” confident trust victorious deeds God belong together. Christian mission means Christians, community Church, confess proclaim historical realisation God’s universal salvation Christ Jesus (cf. “Ad gentes”, 7). They experience sacramental presence liturgy make tangible service others, especially need. It remains qualitative definition Church New Covenant consists Jews Gentiles, even quantitative proportions Jewish Gentile Christians may initially give different impression. Just death resurrection Jesus Christ two unrelated covenants, people covenant Israel disconnected ‘the people God drawn Gentiles’. Rather, enduring role covenant people Israel God’s plan salvation relate dynamically ‘people God Jews Gentiles, united Christ’, Church confesses universal mediator creation salvation. In context God’s universal salvation, people yet received gospel aligned people God New Covenant. “In first place people covenants promises given Christ born according flesh (cf. Rom 9:4-5). On account fathers people remains dear God, repent gifts makes calls issues (cf. Rom 11:28-29)” (“Lumen gentium”, 16). The goals dialogue Judaism The first goal dialogue add depth reciprocal knowledge Jews Christians. One learn love one gradually come know, one know truly profoundly one loves. This profound knowledge accompanied mutual enrichment whereby dialogue partners become recipients gifts. The Conciliar declaration “Nostra aetate” (No. 4) speaks rich spiritual patrimony discovered step step biblical theological studies dialogue. To extent, Christian perspective, important goal mining spiritual treasures concealed Judaism Christians. In regard one must mention interpretation Sacred Scriptures. In foreword Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger 2001 document Pontifical Biblical Commission “The Jewish People Sacred Scriptures Christian Bible”, respect Christians Jewish interpretation Old Testament stressed. It highlights “Christians learn great deal Jewish exegesis practised 2000 years; return Christians may hope Jews profit Christian exegetical research.” In field exegesis many Jewish Christian scholars work together find collaboration mutually fruitful precisely belong different religious traditions. This reciprocal acquiring knowledge must limited specialists alone. Therefore important Catholic educational institutions, particularly training priests, integrate curricula “Nostra aetate” subsequent documents Holy See regarding implementation Conciliar declaration. The Church also grateful analogous efforts within Jewish community. The fundamental changes relations Christians Jews initiated “Nostra aetate” (No. 4) must also made known coming generations received disseminated them. One important goal Jewish-Christian dialogue certainly consists joint engagement throughout world justice, peace, conservation creation, reconciliation. In past, may different religions - background narrowly understood claim truth corresponding intolerance - contributed incitement conflict confrontation. But today religions part problem, part solution. Only religions engage successful dialogue one another, way contribute towards world peace, realised also social political levels. Religious freedom guaranteed civil authority prerequisite dialogue peace. In regard, litmus-test religious minorities treated, rights guaranteed. In Jewish-Christian dialogue situation Christian communities state Israel great relevance, since - nowhere else world - Christian minority faces Jewish majority. Peace Holy Land - lacking constantly prayed - plays major role dialogue Jews Christians. Another important goal Jewish-Catholic dialogue consists jointly combatting manifestations racial discrimination Jews forms anti-Semitism, certainly yet eradicated re-emerge different ways various contexts. History teaches us even slightest perceptible forms anti-Semitism lead: human tragedy Shoah two-thirds European Jewry annihilated. Both faith traditions called maintain together unceasing vigilance sensitivity social sphere well. Because strong bond friendship Jews Catholics, Catholic Church feels particularly obliged possible Jewish friends repel anti-Semitic tendencies. Pope Francis repeatedly stressed Christian never anti-Semite, especially Jewish roots Christianity. Justice peace, however, simply abstractions within dialogue, also evidenced tangible ways. The social-charitable sphere provides rich field activity, since Jewish Christian ethics include imperative support poor, disadvantaged sick. Thus, example, Holy See’s Commission Religious Relations Jews International Jewish Committee Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) worked together 2004 Argentina financial crisis country organise joint soup kitchens poor homeless, enable impoverished children attend school providing meals them. Most Christian churches large charitable organisations, likewise exist within Judaism. These would able work together alleviate human need. Judaism teaches commandment “to walk His ways” (Deut 11:22) requires imitation Divine Attributes (Imitatio Dei) care vulnerable, poor suffering (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 14a). This principle accords Jesus’ instruction support need (cf. eg. Mt 25:35-46). Jews Christians cannot simply accept poverty human suffering; rather must strive overcome problems. When Jews Christians make joint contribution concrete humanitarian aid justice peace world, bear witness loving care God. No longer confrontational opposition cooperating side side, Jews Christians seek strive better world. Saint Pope John Paul II called cooperation address Central Council German Jewry Conference Rabbis Mainz 17 November 1980: “Jews Christians, children Abraham, called blessing world ... , committing together peace justice among men peoples, fullness depth God intended us have, readiness sacrifices goal may demand”. 10 December 2015 Cardinal Kurt Koch President The Most Reverend Brian Farrell Vice-President The Reverend Norbert Hofmann, SDB Secretary ||||| COMMISSION OF THE HOLY SEE FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS Nostra Aetate n. 4 Introduction [Italian] Nostra Aetate n. 4 [English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish] Commission Religious Relations Jews CRRJ Introduction [Italian] Documents Commission “The Gifts Calling God Irrevocable” (Rom 11:29) - A Reflection Theological Questions Pertaining Catholic–Jewish Relations Occasion 50th Anniversary “Nostra aetate” (no.4) [10 December 2015] [English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish] “We Remember: A Reflection Shoah” [1998] [English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish] “Notes correct way present Jews Judaism preaching catechesis Roman Catholic Church” [1985] [English, French, Italian] “Guidelines Suggestions Implementing Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate (n. 4)” [1974] [English, French, Italian] ILC (International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee) Introduction [Italian] Meetings 23° - 2016 4-7 April Warsaw Joint Declaration theme: “The ‘Other’ Jewish Catholic Tradition: Refugees Today’s World"" [English, French, German, Italian, Polish] 22° - 2013 13-16 October Madrid Joint Declaration theme: “Challenges Religion Contemporary Society” [English, German, Italian] 21° - 2011 27 February-2 March Paris Joint Declaration theme: “Forty Years Dialogue – Reflections Future Perspectives” [English, French] 20° - 2008 9-12 November Budapest Joint Declaration theme: “The Role Religion Civil Society Today” [English, Italian] 19° - 2006 4-7 November Cape Town Joint Declaration theme: ""Dignifying Divine Image"": Jewish Catholic Perspectives Health Care Special Reference HIV/AIDS Pandemic” [English, French, German, Italian] 18° - 2004 5-8 July Buenos Aires Joint Declaration theme: Tzedeq Tzedaqah (Justice Charity) [English, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish] 17° - 2001 1-4 May New York Joint Declaration theme: ""Repentance Reconciliation"" [English, French] 2001 4 May New York Joint Declaration theme: ""The Protection Religious Liberties Holy Sites” [English, Italian] 2001 4 May New York Recommendation theme: “Education Catholic Jewish Seminaries Theological Schools” [English, French, Italian] 16° - 1998 23-26 March Vatican City Joint Declaration theme: “What How Do We Ought We Teach About Each Other?""

San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Tuesday that Anderson, 53, who killed Karen Smith and an 8-year-old special-needs student before shooting himself, was allowed to go to Smith's classroom at North Park Elementary School because staff members recognized him, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Burguan says Smith, who separated from Anderson in March after less than three months of marriage, only told close family members that he had threatened her. ""She effectively kept her private life private,"" the chief says. The chief adds that Smith, who had moved back in with her adult children, believed Anderson's threats were only a cry for attention. The 8-year-old boy killed as he stood behind Smith has been identified as Jonathan Martinez, who had the genetic condition Williams syndrome, which causes developmental delays, the Desert Sun reports. School district Superintendent Dale Marsden says Jonathan's parents, who described him as a happy boy, want his death to spread awareness of the disease. A GoFundMe campaign to help the boy's family raised nearly $100,000 by the end of Tuesday. Marsden says a 9-year-old boy hit in the upper body by a bullet who was hospitalized in critical condition is ""up and watching cartoons"" and is expected to make a full recovery."

Cells nearly part body become cancer, spread areas body. To learn cancers start spread, see What Is Cancer? Multiple myeloma cancer formed malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells found bone marrow important part immune system. The immune system made several types cells work together fight infections diseases. Lymphocytes (lymph cells) main cell type immune system. The major types lymphocytes T cells B cells. When B cells respond infection, mature change plasma cells. Plasma cells make antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) help body attack kill germs. Lymphocytes many areas body, lymph nodes, bone marrow, intestines, bloodstream. Plasma cells, however, mainly found bone marrow. Bone marrow soft tissue inside hollow bones. In addition plasma cells, normal bone marrow cells make different normal blood cells. When plasma cells become cancerous grow control, produce tumor called plasmacytoma. These tumors generally develop bone, also rarely found tissues. If someone single plasma cell tumor, disease called isolated (or solitary) plasmacytoma. If someone one plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma characterized several features, including: Low blood counts In multiple myeloma, overgrowth plasma cells bone marrow crowd normal blood-forming cells, leading low blood counts. This cause anemia – shortage red blood cells. People anemia become pale, weak, fatigued. Multiple myeloma also cause level platelets blood become low (called thrombocytopenia). This lead increased bleeding bruising. Another condition develop leukopenia – shortage normal white blood cells. This lead problems fighting infections. Bone calcium problems Myeloma cells also interfere cells help keep bones strong. Bones constantly remade keep strong. Two major kinds bone cells normally work together keep bones healthy strong. The cells lay new bone called osteoblasts. The cells break old bone called osteoclasts. Myeloma cells make substance tells osteoclasts speed dissolving bone. Since osteoblasts get signal put new bone, old bone broken without new bone replace it. This makes bones weak break easily. Fractured bones major problem people myeloma. This increase bone break-down also raise calcium levels blood. (Problems caused high calcium levels discussed section “How multiple myeloma diagnosed?”) Infections Abnormal plasma cells protect body infections. As mentioned before, normal plasma cells produce antibodies attack germs. For example, developed pneumonia, normal plasma cells would produce antibodies aimed specific bacteria causing illness. These antibodies help body attack kill bacteria. In multiple myeloma, myeloma cells crowd normal plasma cells, antibodies fight infection can’t made. The antibody made myeloma cells help fight infections. That’s myeloma cells many copies plasma cell – making copies exact (or monoclonal) antibody. Kidney problems The antibody made myeloma cells harm kidneys. This lead kidney damage even kidney failure. Monoclonal gammopathy Having many copies antibody known monoclonal gammopathy. This condition found blood test. Although people multiple myeloma monoclonal gammopathy, everyone monoclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma. It also occur diseases, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia lymphomas. It also occur disorder known monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance (MGUS), cause problems like multiple myeloma does. However, people MGUS eventually go develop multiple myeloma diseases. Light chain amyloidosis Antibodies made protein chains joined together – 2 short light chains 2 longer heavy chains. In light chain amyloidosis, abnormal plasma cells make many light chains. These light chains deposit tissues, build up. This accumulation light chains lead abnormal protein tissues known amyloid. The buildup amyloid certain organs lead enlarge work well. For example, amyloid builds heart, cause irregular heart beat cause heart enlarge get weaker. A weak heart lead condition called congestive heart failure, symptoms like shortness breath swelling legs. Amyloid kidneys cause work poorly. This may cause symptoms early on, poor kidney function may found blood tests. If gets worse, amyloid kidney lead kidney failure. See section “Signs symptoms multiple myeloma” information signs symptoms light chain amyloidosis. Other names light chain amyloidosis include AL primary amyloidosis. This sometimes considered separate disease multiple myeloma, treatment often similar myeloma, discuss document. Light chain amyloidosis one diseases amyloid builds ups causes problems. Amyloidosis also caused genetic (hereditary) disease called familial amyloidosis. Long-standing (chronic) infection and/or inflammation also cause amyloidosis. This known secondary AA amyloidosis. This document talk kinds amyloidosis. Monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance In monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance (MGUS), abnormal plasma cells produce many copies antibody (a monoclonal antibody protein). However, plasma cells form actual tumor mass cause problems seen multiple myeloma. MGUS usually affect person’s health. In particular, doesn’t cause weak bones, high calcium levels, kidney problems, low blood counts. It’s often found routine blood test finds high level protein blood testing shows protein monoclonal antibody. In MGUS, number plasma cells may increased, still make less 10% cells bone marrow. Some people MGUS eventually develop multiple myeloma, lymphoma, amyloidosis. Each year, 1% people MGUS develops one diseases. The risk higher people whose protein levels particularly high. Patients MGUS don’t need treatment, watched closely see get disease need treated, multiple myeloma. Recently, scientists studied genes plasma cells patients MGUS. They found genetic make-up plasma cells resembles myeloma plasma cells resembles normal plasma cells. This suggests cells truly malignant, slow growing. Because people MGUS generally elderly, may live long enough transform myeloma. Solitary plasmacytomas This another type abnormal plasma cell growth. Rather many tumors different locations multiple myeloma, one tumor, hence name solitary plasmacytoma. Most often, solitary plasmacytoma develops bone, may called isolated plasmacytoma bone. When plasmacytoma starts tissues (such lungs organs), called extramedullary plasmacytoma. Solitary plasmacytomas often treated radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery may used single extramedullary plasmacytoma. As long plasmacytomas found later on, patient’s outlook usually excellent. However, since many people solitary plasmacytoma develop multiple myeloma, people watched closely signs disease. ||||| (CNN) -- Former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw treated cancer, doctors encouraged progress making, NBC said Tuesday.

Mike Parker Pearson University College London working new idea bluestones might lifted onto huge wooden lattices carried dozens men site. But it’s theory. We can’t know, definitively. We better-informed questions. The ineffability Stonehenge dulled appetite. The site long proved irresistible diggers. In 1620, Duke Buckingham men excavate right center monument. Although know time, dug site prehistoric pit. Buckingham’s men found skulls cattle “and beasts” large quantities “burnt coals charcoals”—but treasure, hoped. In 19th century, “barrow-digging,” excavation prehistoric monuments burial hills, popular pastime among landed gentry. In 1839, naval officer named Captain Beamish dug estimated 400 cubic feet soil northeast Altar Stone Stonehenge. As Parker Pearson notes book Stonehenge, Beamish’s “big hole probably final blow prehistoric features...that lay Stonehenge’s center.” Work Stonehenge became less invasive. In 1952, Willard Libby—the American chemist later Nobel Prize winner—used new radiocarbon dating technique piece charcoal pit within Stonehenge date monument 1848 B.C., give take 275 years. That date since refined several times. The prevailing opinion first stones erected site around 2600 B.C. (although building Stonehenge carried millennium, centuries ritual activity site stones place). In 2003, Parker Pearson conducted survey, concentrating nearby settlement Durrington Walls area River Avon. Based huts, tools animal bones uncovered, concluded Durrington Walls likely housed workers built Stonehenge. Based analysis human remains later excavated Stonehenge, also surmised that, far site quotidian religious activity, Stonehenge served cemetery–a “place dead.” The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project different everything came it. When Gaffney team started work, less interested theories data. To end, concentrated taking amounts three-dimensional yards-deep photograph entire landscape. “The perceived wisdom driven monuments knew about,” says Gaffney. “We’ve put data monuments.” *** Chris Gaffney, Vince’s younger, slighter less voluble brother, one instigators new approach. The duo’s grandfather metalwork teacher Newcastle interest archaeology, took clever grandchildren trips Hadrian’s Wall, old barrier Roman Empire blasted north. Small wonder Vince became archaeologist Chris geophysicist, University Bradford. The Gaffney brothers’ interest new technologies becoming available archaeologists led first GPS-guided magnetometer systems. A magnetometer sensors allow geophysicist see evidence historic building, even ancient ditch-digging, beneath soil mapping variations earth’s magnetic field. The GPS-guided versions able pinpoint discoveries within one centimeter. The Gaffneys believed Stonehenge scholarship needed massive magnetometer- radar-led survey whole site. “We didn’t know anything’s there,” Vince Gaffney recalled. “So we’re constructing various hypotheses basis something don’t know.” Around time, Austrian archaeologist named Wolfgang Neubauer, Boltzmann Institute, hoping conduct large-scale projects Europe using tools including GPS magnetometers ground-penetrating radar. Neubauer’s team also developed software process 40 50 gigabytes raw data instruments could create day. Suddenly, instead waiting weeks months see machines found, possible cover several acres magnetometers radar day display information screen almost instantaneously. One areas Neubauer wanted scan Stonehenge, spring 2009 contacted Vince Gaffney. A months later, Boltzmann Institute University Birmingham—plus several British European universities, museums companies contributed expertise resources—began collaboration Stonehenge. Their first days site, Gaffney recalled, “like geophysical circus come town.” Tractors pushed ground-penetrating radars, looked like high-powered lawn mowers. All-terrain vehicles dragged magnetometer sensors long strings. Delicate instruments covering hard, uneven ground kept mechanics technicians busy. “I seen one magnetometers shear clear apart front me,” said Gaffney. “It back service next day.” In all, fieldwork took 120 days, spread four years. *** In multimedia room University Birmingham vast touch screen, six feet nine, new map Stonehenge landscape appeared. Gaffney pointed key features. There Stonehenge itself, marked familiar circles. To north long, thin strip called Stonehenge Cursus Greater Cursus, demarcated ditches, ran east west nearly two miles. (The Cursus given name antiquarian William Stukeley 18th century looked like ancient Roman race course. Its construction predates first building work Stonehenge several hundred years.) Gaffney also pointed Cursus Barrows—hillocks containing mass human graves—just south Cursus itself, King Barrow Ridge east. Scattered map blotches black: features without names. These new finds, including 15 possible new poorly understood Neolithic monuments. Gaffney emphasized possible, acknowledging require digging—“the testimony spade”—to discover precisely there. Standing front constellation evidence, seemed unable decide start, like child Christmas tree. “These little henge monuments,” said, touching screen highlight group black smudges. “Nice little entrance there, ditch. These things know nothing about.” He saved greatest enthusiasm discoveries made Cursus. This feature, said Gaffney, always thought “bloody great barrier north Stonehenge.” Nobody knew quite for. Because Cursus runs east west, archaeologists always believed presence owes something passage sun. The monument must significant: It dug fourth millennium B.C. using antler picks—hundreds thousands man-hours went construction. The Hidden Landscapes Project’s instruments discovered several new clues. First all, found gaps ditch, particular large break northern side, allow people enter exit Cursus. Now, instead seeing Cursus exclusively monument encouraged movement along path sun, east west, Gaffney began consider gaps “channels landscape” guide movement people north south. A bigger discovery, Gaffney says, “bloody huge” pit five yards diameter eastern end Cursus. Today lies buried least three feet surface ground. Such pit much large practical use—for instance, burying trash—because labor involved digging it. In archaeologists’ minds could ritual implications, “a marker kind,” Gaffney said. What’s more, drew straight line pit heelstone Stonehenge, ran directly along final section Avenue, path sunrise summer solstice. “We thought, That’s bit coincidence!” Gaffney recalled. “That point thought, What’s end? And there’s another pit! Two pits, marking midsummer sunrise midsummer solstice, set within monument that’s meant something passage sun.” With hands passing map, Gaffney showed how—on longest days year—the pits formed triangle Stonehenge marking sunrise sunset. “Nobody ever seen pits before,” continued. “But link area Stonehenge Cursus directly. Either things put inside Cursus mark points, Cursus wrapped around them.” What interesting Cursus pits told story landscape. The “sunrise” pit visible Stonehenge, “sunset” pit not—it nestled behind ridge, could seen fire smoke coming it. (At point pits excavated evidence activity.) These discoveries fed larger understanding Stonehenge “diachronic”—operating light dark, sunrise sunset, day night. “The point I think we’re coming to,” said Gaffney, “is increasingly see area around Stonehenge providing extensive evidence complex liturgical movement—which understand, largely know things are.” Parker Pearson, part, takes cautious view new research. “Until dig holes, don’t know you’ve got,” told office University College London. “What date is, significant is. [There are] extraordinary new features coming up, we’re thinking well, they?” To sure, said data Hidden Landscapes Project “backs pattern we’ve already seeing years. We excessive number solstice-aligned monuments landscape. Nowhere rest Europe comes even close.” He added, “This fantastic stuff that’s done, it’s raised whole series new questions,” said. “It’s going take years.” *** The clouds shifted front sun, dappling landscape shadow. Gaffney I walking Avenue, 300 yards Stonehenge, distance string barrows gleamed like opals. Although acknowledged fallibility archaeological projection (“In end,” said, “we wrong”), work led new interpretation Stonehenge used. Gaffney’s idea focus Stonehenge itself, “processionality” within whole landscape. He imagined people moving around area like Roman Catholics processing Stations Cross. He recalled Easter Friday ritual saw Croatia, “bloke cross” led fellow barefoot celebrants miles-long trip. In Gaffney’s view, building great stone circle “monumentalizing” similar, heathen, procession. As walked downhill fields, Gaffney stopped time time point hillocks “the illustrious dead” buried. He also noted Avenue straight line Avon Stonehenge, rather series tacks brought visitor Stonehenge site “theatrical” way, along line sunrise summer solstice. He thrust mind Bronze Age visitor site. “You seen nothing like it,” said. “It would massively impressive.” Soon descended valley called Stonehenge Bottom, hundred yards great stones. “They’re disappearing....Watch, watch!” said. Within yards, monument became invisible. When picture Stonehenge mind’s eye, imagine concentric rings vast stones standing desolate open landscape, visible miles around. But now, were, hundred yards away, thing gone. We stood field, watched lethargic cows, savored strangeness moment. Then, stepped uphill, Stonehenge re-emerged horizon. It happened fast. The lintels, great sarsens, smaller bluestones suddenly us. Gaffney’s voice lifted. He spoke Jerusalem Syndrome: feeling intense emotion experienced pilgrims first sighting Holy City. In prehistoric world, conception God understood later Abrahamic faiths. But, said Gaffney, Stonehenge reappeared us, “whatever ancient version Jerusalem Syndrome is, that’s you’re feeling now.” ||||| The mysteries Stonehenge revealed sometimes unusual methods—forgetting water grass whacking stones quartz.

"Herman Cain expressed confidence Tuesday’s debate much-touted “9-9-9” plan revamp tax code would pass Congress, paid campaign consultant scored plan Cain said idea theory politically viable solution — route would suggest himself. “You’re trying go system taxes income quits double-taxing savings,” Gary Robbins told POLITICO Wednesday. “That’s something really juice economy, it’s probably worth 15 percent growth. … The problem big-bang changes like that, flat tax fair tax, alien current system would great big shock.” Text Size - + reset 2012 field piles 9-9-9 plan POLITICO 44 Though Robbins says plan would work fiscally economically, believes people would never accept drastic changes. Cain repeatedly declined name people involved crafting plan besides Rich Lowrie, Cain’s chief economic adviser, Cleveland-based wealth manager Wells Fargo trained economist. But Robbins, economist worked Steve Forbes’s flat-tax campaigns longtime Treasury employee, conducted 10-page analysis plan September. Robbins found plan revenue neutral, Cain’s trumpeting recent debates interviews. “Economically, it’s fine, there’s nothing wrong plan nothing wrong proposal,” Robbins said. “What Cain done really smart saying go route, way go. He’s done good job fellows beating last night making mistake.” Robbins said he’s performed various economics-related tasks campaign. He said answers questions Lowrie recently week response scathing Wall Street Journal editorial picked apart 9-9-9 plan. “They really technical questions describe things,” Robbins said. “He wanted make sure describing faithfully happening.” Cain spokesman J.D.

The reason incorrect start assumptions make. Remember, 9- 9-9 plan throws current tax code. ... Now, 9-9-9 does, expands base. When expand base, arrive lowest possible rate, 9-9-9.” — Herman Cain, Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, October 11, 2011 A family four making $50,000 year “are still going money left over.” — Cain, MSNBC, October 12, 2011 It almost sounds like something movie “Dave,” accidental president enlists accountant friend, Murray Blum, help figure federal budget. During Tuesday’s Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, Herman Cain, former chief executive Godfather’s Pizza, named Rich Lowrie Cleveland “my lead economist” helped develop Cain’s signature “9-9-9” plan overhauling federal tax system. “He economist, worked business wealth creation career,” Cain said. Actually, according Lowrie’s Linked-In profile, bachelor’s degree accountancy Case Western Reserve University, economics. Lowrie, e-mail, said consider economist, “senior economic advisor” Cain campaign. Donor information maintained Opensecrets.org shows donated $1,500 Cain 2010 2011, also contributed $2,300 Mitt Romney first run presidency 2007. Okay, Cain may exaggerated qualifications economic guru. But forcefully defended ‘9-9-9’ plan, Tuesday night’s debate MSNBC’s “Daily Rundown” Wednesday. Many readers asked us examine plan explain it, let’s take test drive. The Facts The “9-9-9” label actually bit misnomer. Cain would toss much current federal tax code replace it, eventually temporarily, three taxes — 9 percent income tax, 9 percent business transactions tax 9 percent federal sales tax. On paper, first two look like cuts, payroll taxes Social Security Medicare (now nearly 15 percent, including corporate contributions) would repealed. The sales tax would new, top existing state sales taxes. But note said “9-9-9” would happen eventually — temporarily. That’s second step planned three-step process. The first step would cut individual corporate tax rates top 25 percent rate (down current high 35 percent). Then final step would replace taxes — even 9s — national sales tax, known proponents “Fair Tax.” (As denizens Washington, find three-step process highly dubious. It takes years, even decades, fundamentally overhaul tax code. Herman Cain going three times presidency? But digress.) Much attention focused whether Cain’s plan, 9-9-9 stage, would raise much revenue current tax system. Bloomberg News calculated would collect $2 trillion, thus falling short $200 billion year. But Lowrie sent Bloomberg analysis Wednesday asserted “9-9-9” would actually collect slightly — $2.3 trillion. We think revenue question beside point. Anyone turn dials computer models generate assumptions want. Michael Linden left-leaning Center American Progress, instance, estimates plan would generate $1.3 trillion. The biggest difference two estimates Linden thinks 9 percent business tax would yield $112 billion year, Cain says would get $862 billion — gap simply demonstrates different assumptions generate extremely different results. (Linden Thursday updated analysis, saying underestimated much revenue business tax would raise.) Cain’s proposal radical makes sense examine potential impact taxpayers. A key part Cain’s pitch plan debate this: “When expand base, arrive lowest possible rate, 9-9-9.” “Expand base” really means taxpayers pay taxes plan. Right now, nearly half taxpayers don’t pay income taxes, pay share payroll taxes, amounts 7.65 percent wage income (though much capped $107,000). Cain would also eliminate earned-income tax credit, intended lift working Americans poverty. Many workers currently receive tax refunds. On top that, Cain would introduce new sales tax, would affect lower moderate-income people spend income purchases, savings investments. Depending math, people paying zero negative taxes might faced 27 percent tax income. In words, paper Cain promising tax cut, reality tens millions lower-income Americans would face tax increases. People high tax brackets — 28 percent higher — would likely see big tax cuts. (As part plan, Cain would also eliminate estate taxes capital gains taxes, which, again, mostly affect higher-income people stock real estate investments.) There several interesting analyses done “9-9-9” plan. Edward D. Kleinbard University Southern California School Law identifies several unusual quirks, including “disguised one-time 9 percent tax existing wealth — doubt much surprise Mr. Cain followers.” Kleinbard, former chief staff nonpartisan Joint Committee Taxation, says “contrary casual impressions, Plan could expected raise substantial amounts revenue, largely skewing downwards distribution tax burdens compared current law.” Bruce Bartlett, former Reagan administration official calls independent, also offered critical examination week New York Times Economix blog. He (as Kleinbard) noted business tax allows deduction wages, said “is likely raise cost employing workers, even abolition employers’ share payroll tax.” Cain, television appearances, glosses details. “The fact taking embedded taxes built goods services country, prices go up,” asserted MSNBC. “They go up.” He gave example family four earning $50,000. “Today, current system, pay $10,000 taxes assuming standard deductions standard exemptions. I've gone math, $10,000. Now, 9-9-9, they're going pay 9 percent personal — 9 percent tax income. So that's $4,500. They still $5,500 left apply sales tax piece. …They still going money left over.” We’re sure Cain calculates family pays $10,000 taxes, reliable Tax Foundation calculator comes much reasonable figure: total tax bill $3,515 — $690 federal income taxes $2,825 payroll taxes. (The family gets big income-tax savings child tax credit, Cain would eliminate.) So, words, Cain’s plan, family would instantly pay $1,000 income taxes. They would also pay additional sales taxes, probably $3,000, purchases. It’s unclear business tax would affect family’s tax bill appears theoretical family would get tax cut instead 100 percent tax increase. (The picture changes somewhat assume employer-paid payroll taxes automatically would revert employee. We’re sure that’s good bet given design Cain’s business tax, pro-Cain advocates make assumption tax calculator. But even scenario, family appears stuck least $2,000 tax increase.) We take position whether good bad make tax code less progressive. Perhaps response questions, Cain appears still tinkering plan. In Concord, N.H., said Wednesday that, among changes, would preserve deduction charitable donations would exempt used goods, including previously owned homes cars, new 9 percent sales tax. The Pinocchio Test We excuse Cain inflating adviser’s resume, campaign needs address fuzzy math behind tax plan. (We asked campaign copy Lowrie’s analysis receive response. UPDATE: The documents posted below.) Give Cain credit thinking boldly, he’s talking clearly. As far tell limited information Cain provided, plan touts big tax cut would actually increase taxes Americans. Just like would wrong claim pizza low-calorie meal, Cain’s description plan’s impact working Americans highly misleading. Three Pinocchios (About rating scale) Read Cain campaign’s analysis Cain campaign’s revenue estimates Follow Fact Checker Twitter friend us Facebook Read PostPolitics.com The Fix: Why Herman Cain win Romney seen ‘inevitable candidate’ Obama plays defense jobs bill Senate Democrats","– Herman Cain is being dishonest in touting his “9-9-9” plan, positioning it as some kind of tax cut, when “in reality tens of millions of lower income Americans would face tax increases,” Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler has concluded, giving Cain three out of four Pinocchios. The plan would replace the tax code with a 9% corporate tax, 9% income tax and 9% federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on. “Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain’s description of the plan’s impact on working Americans is highly misleading,” Kessler concludes. The plan was dealt another blow yesterday when one of Cain’s own consultants told Politico that, contrary to Cain’s assertions in the debate, the plan was not practical, because it’s “so alien to the current system that it would be a great shock,” and that while it was a fine plan economically, it “wouldn’t be the one I picked."""

But forget anything serious, ladies. He spent part of his appearance, scheduled to air today, holding hands with the First Lady, notes Politico. Obama shrugged off possible criticisms that he should be attending to international diplomacy with world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the UN General Assembly in New York instead of showing up on The View. ""I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys,"" Obama quipped to the five female co-hosts. As the show was being taped, Hillary Clinton was in the city meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, notes the Times. But Obama, for the time being, was sticking to family issues, and talked about how Michelle can make him mad ""when she's being thoroughly unreasonable,"" he joked. Someone no doubt making him mad for real was Mitt Romney, who hammered Obama yesterday on the Mideast, particularly on his handling of the lethal attack on the US consulate in Libya earlier this month. ""These are not bumps in the road; these are human lives,” Romney said yesterday in Colorado, referring to the president's own words concerning problems in the region. “This is time for a president who will shape events in the Middle East."" White House press secretary Jay Carney called the attacks “desperate” and “offensive” attempts by Romney in a race he's losing. Carney might dismiss criticism over Libya, but questions linger."

"It's time absurd Thanksgiving ritual. On Wednesday, National Turkey Foundation carry two plump male turkeys White House lift onto table. President Obama give goofy names like Caramel Popcorn. Then Obama ""pardon"" turkeys and, instead lopping heads tossing oven, let live rest lives estate Mount Vernon. To fair, president lots frivolous public events like one every year. But turkey pardon stands especially dumb worth abolishing. Here's why: -- It's even real tradition! The National Turkey Federation donated two turkeys White House every year since 1947. Harry Truman Dwight D. Eisenhower sensible thing simply ate birds. No pardons there. Some accounts credit John F. Kennedy first official turkey pardon, like JFK mythologizing, overblown sentimentality: Kennedy merely sent one turkeys back farm big enough. ""We'll let one grow,"" groused inadequate offering. (Others credit Abraham Lincoln, spared turkey destined Christmas dinner son Tad pleaded mercy, clearly catch decades.) Ronald Reagan technically first president ""pardon"" Thanksgiving turkey, 1987 — joke distract press scandal. Reporters hounding president whether planned grant pardons key Iran-Contra figures like Oliver North John Poindexter. Reagan merely quipped would pardoned year's turkey en route petting zoo already. Two years later, 1989, Reagan's successor George H.W. Bush made turkey pardon annual ritual. But started glib one-liner meant deflect attention away White House lawbreaking. Hardly sacred convention. -- The pardoned turkeys much better — life turkey misery pain. This going get gruesome, I'm sorry that. But modern-day domestic turkeys bred happy life. They're raised large possible slaughtered soon possible produce greatest volume delicious turkey meat. Some fun facts: Turkeys bred eating grow average 30 pounds — much bigger wild turkeys.* (The two turkeys way White House 37 pounds apiece.) These domesticated turkeys often fat skeletons unable support weight. They frequently develop bone deformities degenerative joint diseases. They're incapable breeding own. They often suffer heart failure bleeding around kidneys. So coincidence that, US News & World Report National Journal discovered, pardoned turkeys die within year granted reprieve anyway. The White House wants us believe turkeys living life leisure farm bopping along favorite Lady Gaga tracks. Not so: For record, I'm opposed raising turkeys food (and, yes, possible get humanely raised turkeys). But clear need elaborate White House ceremony designed obscure food actually comes from. -- It's mockery presidential pardon, all-too neglected issue. Maybe surprising, since turkey pardon basically invented way mocking presidential pardons. Still, worth mentioning. After tomorrow, Obama ""pardoned"" 10 turkeys (turkeys that, best tell, actually committed crimes). By contrast, pardoned commuted sentences 40 actual living human beings. The latter record low modern-day presidents. At point presidency, Ronald Reagan pardoned 313 people. Harry Truman pardoned 1,537 people: Last year, Sam Morrison, official spent 13 years Justice Department's Office Pardon Attorney retiring 2010, described prevailing attitude toward pardons way: ""They tend view grant clemency good thing, criminal justice success story, almost defeat — taking away something good prosecutor achieved."" (The Justice Department disputed characterization.) Over National Journal, Ron Fournier pointed that, bare minimum, Obama could grant clemency people still serving extra time prison old crack-sentencing guidelines — guidelines Obama opposed excessive Congress reduced new prisoners 2010. So far, however, there's sign White House this. The White House does, however, flashy Web site letting vote favorite soon-to-be-pardoned turkey. Yes, hashtags. * Fixed weight numbers. ||||| Story highlights Each year, American president ""pardons"" turkey two Thanksgiving President Barack Obama sent turkeys Mt.

In two years prior, three four pardoned turkeys died less five months pardon. The turkey - Peace, pardoned 2011 - lived 16 months arriving Mount Vernon. So birds -- others bred eaten -- die faster wild brethren? ""The birds fed way increase weight,"" Norton, worked Mount Vernon since 1969, said. ""[Americans] want nice big breasted turkey fed high protein diet get quite large. The organs, though, bird meant smaller bird. They can't handle extra weight, end living long [as wild turkeys]."" The differences extend beyond life expectancy, too. ""Your native bird fly beautifully roost trees,"" Norton said, type receive pardons ""does fly, short stubbly legs typically last right Thanksgiving."" Final years? Figuratively In 2012, Obama announced pardons Cobbler Gobbler, hinted birds final years, telling audience headed Mount Vernon ""where spend twilight years storied home George Washington."" The word ""years,"" however, seems exaggeration. The National Turkey Federation, group lobbies turkey industry selects honored year White House, disagrees notion lives birds cut short. They bred consumption ""life expectancy 18 weeks,"" said Keith Williams, spokesman turkey federation. ""They raised pets animals pets."" Their short lives, Williams points out, says Americans taste turkey breeding practices mistreatment short lives. Bred stuffed Starting 1960, farmers specifically started breeding plump turkeys large amounts white breast meat -- response American demand. The differences wild bred turkeys, Williams said, stems mostly diet. ""A turkey bred exclusively eating, eats corn soybean minerals them,"" Williams said. According federation, whopping 219 million turkeys consumed United States 2011. On Thanksgiving year, group estimates 46 million gobbled up. Since 1970, around time breeding practices changed, turkey consumption increased 104 percent, according federation. The practice pardoning turkey White House dates Abraham Lincoln. The story goes around Thanksgiving, turkeys brought White House Lincoln's son, Tad, grew attached one particular bird begged chief executive father spare fowl table. Lincoln agreed turkey lived. It unclear practice continued next 100 years. But 1963, President John F. Kennedy decided send turkey back farm came from, telling National Turkey Federation ""just let one grow"" instead. Bush ""41"" sent Frying Pan Park The tradition became official 1989, President George H.W. Bush. On November 14, weeks Thanksgiving, Bush pardoned turkey White House shipped live twilight year -- Frying Pan Park -- Herndon, Virginia. Since then, President pardoned turkey year. All Obama's turkeys sent Mount Vernon. The birds spent holidays public pen moved livestock area view ""historically accurate"" Washington's time period. According Norton, turkey federation wanted birds prominently displayed. So year, head Morven Park, historic estate Leesburg, Virginia, January 7. The estate home Former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, ran 1918 1922. Davis prodigious turkey farmer, according Teresa Davenport, spokeswoman Morven Park. As near certainty turkeys soon die, Davenport said ""are going everything [they] make happen."" ""These turkeys raised Minnesota, used cold winters,"" Davenport said. ""A lot employees already turkey duty.""","– President Obama will ""pardon"" a pair of turkeys today and send them to live at Mount Vernon, and if that gives you a case of the warm fuzzies, you should know that both ""Caramel"" and ""Popcorn"" will probably be dead within the year. Every turkey the president has ever pardoned is dead, including the two pardoned last year, CNN points out, with one only lasting until February. In the two previous years, three of the four died in less than five months (the other held out an impressive 16 months). The reason: The birds are bred for food, not longevity. Their normal-sized internal organs can only hold up to their carefully engineered bulk for so long. A spokesman for the National Turkey Federation, the lobbying group that provides the birds, says they have ""a life expectancy of about 18 weeks. They are not raised as pets."" It's one reason Brad Plumer at the Washington Post wants to end the pardon—the others being that it mocks real presidential pardons, and isn't nearly the historic tradition it pretends to be. Of course, at this point columns decrying the pardon are becoming a tradition of their own."

According to AFP, the man was mugging people. But reporters at the scene say it happened completely differently. They say people ducked for cover when gunshots rang out as thousands of people left the stadium. They then saw the shooter running into a nearby car and driving off. On Saturday, the Brazilian military executed a controlled explosion near the finish line of the men's road cycling race. They were blowing up a suspicious bag that had been left unattended, the Guardian reports. Officials say the bag may have belonged to a homeless man, but they had to take precautions. The racers were 60 miles away at the time, but the explosion ""stunned"" people hoping to watch the end of the race, according to AFP. The Sydney Morning Herald reports a bullet came ripping through the media room at the Deodora equestrian center and landed near a photographer Saturday.

According paper, Americans work nearly 25% hours Europeans. In words, that’s additional 258 hours per year hour weekday. The working paper, yet published, written three economists—Alexander Bick Arizona State University, Bettina Bruggeman McMaster University Ontario, Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln Goethe University Frankfurt. The authors looked 18 European countries U.S. Of 19 total countries examined, U.S. came top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; Italy worked fewest hours average 18.4 hours. The study looked hours per person. It doesn’t include people currently workforce, either retired taking time reason, like unemployment vacation. Ultimately, doesn’t measure productivity, rather total time spent work. The disparity hours worked U.S. Europe could explained various ways or, likely, amalgamation numerous different reasons. Taxes, one, much higher Europe U.S. According Bloomberg, gives European workers less incentive work longer hours. It may also something labor unions, generally power Europe U.S. Additionally, Europeans tend get generous pensions, rather investment plans like 401(k) many American workers receive. As result, American workers 65-years-old point past 50 years.","– Feel like you're working too much? Consider moving to Europe: Europeans work 19% fewer hours than US workers, or about one hour less per weekday, a new paper finds. Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the US and Europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that Americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, Fortune reports. Compare that to Italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as Quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, US and Western European workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, Bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the US, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in Europe, so it's more likely they'll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in Europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in Europe, and pensions are more generous there."
