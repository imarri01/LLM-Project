double digits,"– It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. ""A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,"" said one analyst. Click for NPR's state-by-state breakdown of what could happen."

The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London. “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who ""removed"" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as ""there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it."""

Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own—to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. ”We have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,” says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)"

future the burning platform upon man found himself caused man shift behaviour take bold brave step uncertain future he able tell story now great opportunity same stephen,"– Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business? We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: ""Fear of dying alone."" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation ""manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,"" Herman argues—like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. ""It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades"" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. ""There already is an apple,"" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that ""Microsoft needed to make a bold move"" or face ""certain terminal decline,"" and that the price it paid for Nokia ""seems extremely reasonable."" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform—a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move—to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move ""was basically a total failure."" To read the full parable, click here."

monday least six capitalpunishment cases docket recent wave executions keeping justices late field lastminute appeals in weeks ahead court set hear arguments constitutionality capital sentences florida georgia kansas pennsylvania the focus execution issues follows 54 ruling last term involving sedative used lethal injections the split,"– The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports. The court—which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage—will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. ""It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,"" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. ""One person, one vote"": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter—leaving out immigrants and children—Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an ""undue burden"" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals."

York City, George Washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the Bull's Head tavern. Now a preservationist thinks he's found the historic site—and if he's right, it could be the oldest building in Manhattan. Adam Woodward had heard that the building at 50 Bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have ""the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones,"" he tells CBS New York. So he searched the basement, and ""found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,"" he says. Specifically, he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the Colonial era. Since that time, the building has housed a drugstore, a Chinese restaurant, and a beer garden, among other things. Now he's hoping city officials will preserve the site, saying, ""What an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge."" A historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern, and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Eater NY reports. But ultimately, the commission says, it ""cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology,"" so a lot depends on him. He's apparently not talking yet; the New York Times couldn't get hold of him."

Israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of Palestinian rockets fired yesterday, which Palestinians say were in response to another Israeli airstrike earlier in the day, Reuters reports. More than 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza since June, but this was the first time Hamas acknowledged responsibility. As usual the rockets failed to harm anyone, though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo. The incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into Israeli airspace this weekend, which some have speculated came from Iran. An Iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that Israel is vulnerable, and that its anti-missile defense system ""does not work and lacks the necessary capacity."" But he denied that the drone was made by Iran, saying such accusations represented a ""psychological operation"" on Israel's part. ""The Zionist regime has many enemies,"" he said. Iran, meanwhile, is blaming Israel for a hack attack on its oil rigs."

Its papers identified it as a $37 ""art craft/toy"" and also included the line ""Joyeux Noel,"" or Merry Christmas, the New York Times reports. A man named ""Robert"" attempted to send the package to a climate-controlled warehouse in Queens, New York, in December, but custom officials at the Port of Newark seized what turned out to be Picasso's 1911 La Coiffeuse (The Hairdresser). French museum officials traveled to New York last month and confirmed the find is indeed the missing Picasso work, which the Centre Georges Pompidou realized was missing from its storerooms in 2001 following a loan request; it was then valued at more than $2.5 million. Court documents don't specify whether the sender or would-be recipient have been identified, NBC News reports, but ""a lost treasure has been found,"" US attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. She filed a civil complaint yesterday that will have the painting returned to France. The Pompidou's director, who called the painting's rediscovery a ""true comfort,"" hopes the painting can go on display at the museum as early as May, the AP reports. (Another Picasso work was stolen days before this one was found.)"

According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she’ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine. Wendy’s drive-thrus see their share of action: last year, a worker was allegedly bit over a wrong order in Virginia, while a Florida man reportedly threw an alligator through a drive-thru window as a prank."

The Morning News identifies the officer as Rogelio Santander. He'd been called to the store around 4pm by a cop who was working an off-duty job there and noticed Armando Luis Juarez was behaving oddly. The off-duty cop detained Juarez and learned he had an outstanding felony warrant. Santander and Crystal Almeida, 26, responded to the scene; authorities say they and a loss prevention officer employed by Home Depot were shot by Juarez as he was being escorted from the store. A source tells CBS Dallas Santander was shot in the back of the head and Almeida was shot in the face. She remains in critical condition, as does the Home Depot employee. Police say Juarez fled and a high-speed car chase ensued, per the AP. He was apprehended Tuesday night and is being held on charges of aggravated assault on a public servant and felony theft. ""We got our man,"" said Mayor Mike Rawlings."

In a press release published Friday, the Coast Guard says the 28 calls have originated from around the area of Annapolis, Maryland. Each call involved the same male voice and used an emergency radio channel. He's been making the calls since July 2014. The two most recent calls were made on the night of July 21 and the early morning of July 22. “A hoax call is a deadly and serious offense,” a Coast Guard rep tells NBC4, which notes that such calls are a felony that carry six years in prison, $10,000 civil fine, $250,000 criminal fine, and reimbursement to the Coast Guard. ""Calls like these not only put our crews at risk, but they put the lives of the public at risk.”"

""And that white president's name is Barack Obama."" His evidence that Obama is actually white? The president used to be called ""Barry,"" he likes to golf, he wears ""mom jeans,"" and he has a Portugese water dog, among other things. Amy Poehler kept her endorsement brief and to the point: ""If you can vote, go vote for Obama,"" she concludes.

Police got a call from the apartment that afternoon and arrived to find Benjamin Ullestad, 25, and Brandon Ullestad, 22, dead from gunshot wounds. A handgun was found at the scene, and police ""do not believe there are any outstanding suspects,"" per a spokesperson, but the investigation is ongoing. Police say there is no threat to the community, CBS LA reports. Possibilities so far include a murder-suicide or an accident, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Orange County Register reports it's not clear who made the ""distressed"" 911 call from the apartment, and notes that an ""accident-suicide"" is a possibility. Neighbors say the area is typically quiet, making the incident particularly surprising. According to the brothers' Facebook pages, both attended Cal State Long Beach and Benjamin was a legal assistant at a Newport Beach law firm; both Facebook pages feature photos of the men shooting guns. Police found a June 28 receipt for a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun on a table by the door. Their mother also lives in the apartment where the brothers were found, but was in Tennessee when they died."

The following day, David Petraeus appeared before House and Senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that Congress could use. By noon on Sept. 14, a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-Qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term ""extremists"" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: ""The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo."" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring. He sent the CIA an email summarizing his thoughts the next day—but Susan Rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before, so that she could prep for her news show appearances.

An island has formed in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where a volcano has been erupting since Dec. 20. Tonga's Ministry of Lands, Survey, and Natural Resources tells the Weather Network the volcano is erupting from two vents. One is spewing ash and rock onto an uninhabited island; the other is underwater. An expert who came within a mile of the new island, 40 miles northwest of the capital, says it's roughly a square mile in size. But as it's made of loose scoria—a dark volcanic rock—he says it should erode away within a few months once the volcano quiets, the AP reports. If it were formed from lava, it might be more durable. Still, ""it's quite an exciting site, you get to see the birth of an island,"" the expert says. Ministry officials say rocks are being thrown some 1,300 feet into the air, while the volcano is sending steam into the atmosphere. Bits of ash are now climbing about 6,000 feet, down from 30,000 feet last week. That means planes diverted from the area can now pass over safely. However, ash and acidic rain are still showering anything in a 6-mile radius, killing tree leaves on neighboring islands, ABC Australia reports. The volcano last erupted over five years ago."

That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a ""lop-sided"" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the Blaze notes, Republicans want to scale back the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need—and trimmed $8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the Census numbers: 27% of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9% who did in 1960 10% of kids live with a grandparent, 15% have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6% have a stay-at-home dad, and 38% have at least one foreign-born parent 48% of households are made up of married couples, down from 76% in 1940 Americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947"

""Starbucks! This is what I'm talking about!"" wrote Rebecca King. The 28-year-old tells First Coast News she was surprised on Monday when she drove up to the St. Augustine Starbucks ordering window and a barista appeared on a two-way video screen to take her order via sign language. She went back the next day to record video of her doing the same thing. ""It is a big deal to (the) deaf community that Starbucks has one now. Nowhere else has that!"" says King. ""We all want to have that at every drive-thru in the world."" The barista is 22-year-old Katie Wyble, who tells Action News Jax she's had a ""passion for sign language since I first saw a teacher use it when I was in preschool""; she continued to study it in grade school, high school, and college. ""I think more people need to know about what we’re doing because it moves customer service to a whole new level,” Wyble adds. “I hope it helps make more people aware of what they can to do serve others in their communities."" St. Augustine has a large deaf community and the Starbucks in question is brand-new. It's not clear whether other Starbucks locations have the same capability, but the Huffington Post notes that at least two other chains, Culver's and Subway, have installed their own technology to help deaf customers order."

Per the Miami Herald, Diana Fiscal-Gonzalez was caught after harvesting dozens of queen conchs from the coast of Key West. Fiscal-Gonzalez, who was visiting from Texas, was reportedly arrested July 13 by a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer following a tip. Fiscal-Gonzalez had a reported 40 conch shells in a plastic container. She told authorities she didn't know it was illegal to collect the live creatures in the state of Florida. A judge sentenced her to jail, anyway, as well as to six months probation. Fiscal-Gonzalez will have to pay a $500 fine as well as $268 in court costs, according to USA Today. The conch has been a protected species in Florida since the 1970s, when over-harvesting led to a steep decline in their population in the region. In the Florida Keys, the conch is especially beloved. Floridians native to the stretch of islands refer to themselves as conchs and Key West High School's mascot is the endearingly named Fighting Conch. An FWC officer said most of the conchs Fiscal-Gonzalez took were still alive and returned to the water following her arrest."

Politico describes it as an “elimination round,” with everyone except Mitt Romney—and maybe the seemingly immovable Ron Paul—“one misstep away from political death."" Here’s what to watch for: Will anyone touch Herman Cain’s scandal? Focusing on that circus might hurt the GOP brand, the Daily Beast points out, “so they may instead let him bleed slowly as they avert their eyes.” Who can be the Not-Mitt? Anti-Romney sentiment coalesced this week, but has no standard bearer. Newt Gingrich is gaining some buzz, especially after his heart-to-heart with Cain, so some speculate that he's next. Who matters? “For Huntsman, Santorum, and Bachmann, the debate is totally about relevance and trying to maintain some respectability,” an ex-Huntsman campaign manager says. “Not much more, I don’t think.” Will Rick Perry be sober? Perry is reeling after his, um, interesting New Hampshire speech. Perry can come off “like a deer caught in headlights,” says one strategist. “He’s got to decide, what are the two or three messages I’m going to drive?” What about Mitt? “Romney can begin to play ball-control politics,” says a former McCain adviser. “He just needs to be reassuring and not say anything really dumb."""

those aforementioned comments, aren't sitting so well with Jesse Jackson. In discussing his youth in pre-civil rights era Louisiana, the Duck Dynasty patriarch said, in part: I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. ... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" In a Dec. 23 statement obtained by ABC News, Jackson addressed Robertson's comments in no uncertain terms. ""These statements are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago. At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law. Robertson’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law, within a context of what he seemed to believe was 'white privilege.'"" Jackson, his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and GLAAD in the statement demand a meeting with A&E execs ... along with Cracker Barrel's CEO, to discuss content and merchandising."

using vitro fertilization  follow africa news httpstwittercomapafrica,"– Eight endangered rhinos have died after a move to a new park in Kenya. Per the AP, the black rhinos died in what Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu calls ""a complete disaster"" after they were relocated from two locations to Tsavo East National Park last month. Officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause, pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home. When the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty, they likely drank even more, possibly leading to their deaths, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. The rhinos were among 11 moved to the park, and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored. The planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended. As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500. The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas. While deaths can and do occur with such moves, officials say a death rate of this magnitude is uncommon. Kenyan wildlife officials said the results of an investigation into the deaths would be made public as soon as it concludes."

Soldiers in the South heard about six shots, then allowed the soldier to cross the DMZ. He is still being interrogated. “We'll see as he's debriefed and it's just a one-off incident, so I don't think there's too much we can read into it besides that at this point,” says an analyst with the International Crisis Group. Pyongyang, not surprisingly, has not confirmed the incident, reports the BBC. The North generally puts only its best soldiers at the border after a careful vetting process, and defections are rare. One reason: The family of a defecting soldier is sure to face harsh punishment, notes VOA."

mechanized motorized systems removing material water contact reporter heather hacking 8967758,"– This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have ""rearranged the rivers"" and ""move things around."" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. ""I'm going to have a ball,"" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

But per a lawsuit the couple has now filed against Big Coat, the production company behind Love It or List It, as well as the local contractor who overhauled the home, they were left with ""disastrous work,"" including holes in the floor and windows painted shut, the Charlotte Observer reports. The suit also alleges the ""reality-TV"" program is ""scripted, with 'roles' and reactions assigned to the various performers and participants, including the homeowners."" And the show's hosts, designer Hilary Farr and real estate agent David Visentin, and its resident general contractor? ""Actors or television personalities … [who don't play] more than a casual role in the actual renovation process."" Per their contract with Big Coat, the couple deposited $140,000 that would be used to pay Aaron Fitz Construction and its subcontractors. About $85,000 was distributed to Aaron Fitz during the overhaul, even though Murphy and Sullivan say they expressed concerns about mediocre reviews seen on Angie's List. The rest of the money got pumped into producing the show, the couple claims, reports Today.com. They say the show is ""even more of a scam than it generally seems,"" as the AV Club frames it. ""The homeowners' funds essentially pay the cost of creating a stage set for this television series,"" the suit says. A statement from Big Coat's CEO says the company will ""vigorously defend what we consider to be false allegations."" (This DIY project took six months to make and much less time to eat.)"

Attorneys for 14-year-old Anissa Weier signaled this week that they want to change her plea in the attempted murder case from not guilty to ""NGI,"" meaning that she's likely to be committed to a state mental hospital for treatment if found not guilty, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Co-accused Morgan Geyser, who is also 14, has been diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia and has already entered an NGI plea. Both girls were 12 years old in 2014 when they allegedly stabbed a 12-year-old classmate 19 times and left her for dead in what they told investigators was an attempt to please the online horror character ""Slender Man."" In July, an appeals court ruled that they should be tried as adults for the attempted killing. WISN reports that lawyers for both girls are seeking to have the case heard by jurors from outside Waukesha County, where the attack took place, because of heavy media coverage."

man murdered his 67-year-old stepdaughter—and he might have gotten away with it if she hadn't been wearing a Fitbit. Police say they found Karen Navarra dead at her home Sept. 13 with a kitchen knife in her hand and deep wounds to her head and neck, ABC News reports. After the medical examiner concluded that she had been murdered by somebody who tried to make the death look like a suicide, investigators used surveillance footage to determine that stepfather Anthony Aiello had visited her the day of her death. He told them he had seen her later in the day—but her Fitbit revealed that her heart rate spiked, slowed, then stopped while he was at the house. During a police interview, ""Aiello was confronted about the information from Fitbit and the corresponding surveillance video indicating that his car was in the driveway,"" police said in a statement. After police explained ""the abilities of the Fitbit to record time, physical movement and heart rate data,"" Aiello claimed somebody else must have been in the house. He also claimed that two shirts with blood splatter found in his garage must have gotten that way after he cut himself and shook his hand, KOAT reports. Aiello, who is married to Navarra's 92-year-old mother, was arrested and charged with murder last week. (A Fitbit told a different story after this man said a fat intruder killed his wife.)"

According to Chicagoist, John Doe claims the university disciplines male students ""who accept physical contact initiated by female students."" The University of Chicago was recently accused of not doing enough for female students who had been sexually assaulted, but John Doe's lawsuit claims the university has now gone too far in the other direction, the Chicago Maroon reports. He says the university did nothing when the two women called him a sexual predator online and in public, leading to the protest of a theater production he directed. He claims the university ignored a Title IX complaint he filed against one of the women after she filed a similar complaint against him. The lawsuit states he was even removed from a physics class he shared with one of the women at her request. In addition to suing the University of Chicago for creating a ""hostile environment for men,"" John Doe is also suing one of the women. (Something similar happened at the University of Texas-Austin.)"

The parents of 21-year-old Savannah Gold say their suspicions were immediately aroused by the ""really strange"" message they received after she left for work at the Bonefish Grill in Jacksonville last Wednesday, People reports. ""Hey i just wanted to tell you and mom i met a really great guy and we’re running away together,"" one message to her father said. ""I love him and we're leaving tonight i'll call you later when we get to where we are going."" ""He showed it to me and I immediately knew that it was someone else,"" mother Sharon Gold tells Action News Jax. ""We text each other all day ... and this was not from my daughter."" Says father Daniel Gold, ""The spelling was all whacked out."" After Gold's car was found in the restaurant's parking lot with a slashed tire and her purse still inside, authorities identified manager Lee Rodarte, 28, as a suspect because of inconsistencies in his story. Police say Rodarte, who was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Gold, eventually admitted killing her and led them to her body, which he had dumped in a lake. Investigators believe Rodarte was the one who sent the text to Gold's parents. Her parents say after the disappearance, he told them he was worried about her and even helped hand out missing-person flyers. He has been charged with murder and evidence tampering and is being held without bond."

The gossip rags are teeming with stories about the singer's rebellious ways, and Newser rounds up the juicy tidbits: Sign No. 1 that she's nearing breakdown: The singer apparently spent yesterday shopping in SoHo ... wearing a strapless bra ... that was pretty darn see-through, reports the New York Post. (Click to see a photo.) She now appears naked on a billboard in Times Square, but that's not the falling-apart part. The Daily Mail notes that the ad promotes her perfume Rebelle, and it's the second fashion ad to create buzz this week. The Sun apparently claimed Rihanna used a body double in a sexy Armani Jeans ad, leading the singer to tweet, ""Ok @thesunnewspaper, this is the only way I could say this to you!!! F*** YOU."" (Click to read the whole tweet, which gets nastier.) She's hanging out with Chris Brown ... in the presence of her family. The Post reports that Brown watched a Miami Heat game with Rihanna's family over the weekend. The two later sat in separate booths at a Meatpacking District club; he sent her table two bottles of champagne. Still, the Post notes that they two have been careful to keep ""a coy distance."" She has, horrors, been taking more vacations. A source tells the Post that her management and record label execs want her to buckle down, but instead Rihanna is having fun and ""posting more on Twitter."""

Authorities say the man took a cab to the bank, asked the driver to idle while he went inside, and then had the cabbie drive him to Denver International Airport. Officials say it's unknown if the suspect actually boarded a plane after going to the airport, the AP reports. Video from inside the cab clearly shows the man's face, and pictures taken in the Public Service Credit Union show the man wearing what appears to be a white dust mask while inside the bank, where he threatened a teller with a small handgun."

The ""toilet brush"" of a tree now standing in one of the city's busiest public squares and being roundly mocked in Italy and around the world makes Charlie Brown's Christmas tree look lush by comparison. The New York Times reports that the 72-foot-tall Norway spruce erected in the Piazza Venezia and nicknamed ""Spelacchio,"" or ""Mangy,"" will cost the city about $57,000 in all—and locals are outraged that so much money was outlayed for a tree that one expert says ""has clearly been traumatized."" Thrillist documents some of the online reaction to the sad, needle-sparse spruce, which it calls a ""balding network of pines and brittle branches."" ""Maybe the dogs drank all the water in the tree stand?"" one amused viewer tweeted, while another offered a backhanded compliment: ""Big fan of Rome's Christmas tree for looking how we all feel."" Others defend the tree, saying it looks OK when it's lit up at night. ""We are all Spelacchio!"" one supporter told a local paper. Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: ""I have more followers than branches."" A consumer rights group that calls the tree a ""shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists"" is lobbying to have the tree taken down and has asked a local court to scrutinize the tree's costs. Rome's mayor says her office is also looking into TreeGate."

supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg ive spoken respect appreciation eight justices supreme court kavanaugh said i know theyre dedicated public servants given great deal country barring surprises kavanaugh appears likely win confirmation time take place alongside eight justices supreme court begins fall term next month not seeing video click here,"– Day three of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang: Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he has ordered his staff to release a Kavanaugh email even though it's supposed to remain under wraps. It's not clear yet what the email says, but NBC News reports that it concerns racial profiling. Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. ""I openly invite and accept the consequences,"" he said, per CNN. ""The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate."" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges ""the secret or confidential business"" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. ""Bring the charges,"" said Booker. ""All of us are ready to face that rule,"" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is ""settled law."" He was going over a draft opinion stating that ""it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,"" but he took exception to the phrase. ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,"" he wrote at the time. As the Times notes, Kavanaugh didn't state his personal opinion on the matter."

After getting a death threat from the jihadist website RevolutionMuslim.com, the show pulled the prophet Mohammed out of this week's episode, bleeping out all mention of his name, putting “censored” banners over parts of the episode and, where necessary, replacing him with Santa Claus in a bear suit, the Huffington Post reports. Here's the deal: last week's episode (which you can see a clip of here) mocked the taboo against showing the prophet Mohammed, having him show up first hidden inside a U-Haul, and then inside a bear costume. This week's episode was to continue that story. It's unclear whether the extra censorship is intended to appease the irony-challenged folks at RevolutionMuslim or mock them. South Park, incidentally, has tackled the issue before, and even depicted Mohammed on screen once with impunity."

having raised more than $500,000 each for the president, reports MSNBC. That's a sizeable jump from the 27 bundlers—well-connected supporters who help candidates raise big money—reported three months ago. It's also a sign that we're getting closer to the 2012 election season, predicted to be the most expensive ever. ""The emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events, particularly asking for $2,500,"" said a campaign finance expert. ""Events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed his pace for 2007."" Obama and the DNC have raised more than $165 million so far, well ahead of the Republican field—however, the really big money of Wall Street is increasingly lining up behind Mitt Romney and the GOP, reports the New York Times. Since the spring, Romney has raised more than $1.5 million from banks, hedge funds, and other financial firms; Obama, however, has gotten just $270,000. Goldman Sachs employees alone gave Obama more than $1 million in 2008, but so far in this election cycle, he's gotten just $45,000; Romney, on the other hand, has received $350,000 from them."

Jimmy Causey, 46, has been missing from the Lieber Correctional Institution since around 2pm Wednesday, the AP reports. In his previous escape, he broke out of the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 with convicted murderer Johnny Brewer by hiding in a trash truck. After three days on the run, they were recaptured at a motel 100 miles away on Interstate 95 when a pizza delivery driver recognized them and tipped off authorities. Residents near the Ridgeville, SC, prison have been urged to ""remain vigilant, keep vehicles and homes secured"" while the search continues. Causey, who first went to state prison for grand larceny in 1992, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping prominent Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his wife and daughter, the Post and Courier reports. He held the lawyer—who had represented him in previous cases—at gunpoint and demanded money. During the trial, the court heard that Swerling had managed to get reduced sentences for Causey on two occasions in the 1990s, but Causey still held a grudge about having been sent to prison at all."

Lois Lerner had been in charge of the agency's tax-exempt unit, which singled out conservative groups for added scrutiny. Her immediate boss already has been forced into early retirement, and critics have been calling for Lerner's head to roll as well. (Her role in using a planted question to make the controversy public hasn't helped her cause.) On Capitol Hill yesterday, Lerner denied any wrongdoing but invoked the Fifth in refusing to answer questions. The chair of the House Oversight panel, Darrell Issa, says he plans to call her back to testify, arguing that she waived her right to the Fifth by making an opening statement, reports the Hill. The decision to put Lerner on leave comes days after the new acting chief of the IRS, Daniel Werfel, took over."

The Daily Item reports the Shikellamy Middle School teacher was asked by 6th-grade student Mary Reinard for help in sending a letter to Clinton. Mary wrote the letter, in which she reportedly asked Clinton if she really spoke to the dead (a 1996 book said she had imaginary chats with Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi, but not Jesus, as a ""therapeutic release,"" per a CNN article published at the time). She and Attinger put it in an envelope bearing the school's return address, and Attinger addressed it: to ""HILIAR RODHAM CLINTON."" Mary brought the letter home to stamp and mail, and stepmom Shannon Reinard spotted the ""liar"" in the name and called the school on Friday. In a voicemail Attinger left the Sunbury mom, he apologized and claimed it was a ""kind of a joke ... because I was telling her it (talking to the dead) wasn't true."" The family met with Attinger and administrators on Tuesday and say they've accepted his apology and don't want him fired. Mary says she's relieved she didn't mail the letter as it was; she hadn't spotted the typo. ""I would have felt embarrassed. I wouldn't have been able to go to school for a week."" Now, instead of embarrassed, she's ""nervi-cided."" That's nervous and excited, because after Chelsea Clinton on Wednesday tweeted she'd be happy to hand-deliver the letter to her mom, she was connected with Shannon Reinard on Twitter and told her they'd be on the lookout for the letter, which had been properly mailed. ""Please thank Mary for her courage,"" Chelsea Clinton wrote, per the Meadville Tribune."

serviceman has become the world's first man to ever receive a full penis and scrotum transplant. Per USA Today, the veteran was injured by an IED years ago while on combat tour in Afghanistan. Surgeons from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced the historic news on Monday after performing the unprecedented surgery in Baltimore last month. The patient is expected to recover both urinary and sexual function, according to the surgeons. Surgeons said they rebuilt the man's entire pelvic region over the course of 14 hours. Per the AP, the scrotum transplant did not include the donor's testicles, meaning reproduction won't be possible. ""We just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions"" with that extra step, said Hopkins' Dr. Damon Cooney. Three other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex. Hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. The Hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient's immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several. In a statement from Hopkins, the patient was quoted as saying: ""When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal."""

two other boys were injured after a chain link fence electrified by a live underground wire electrocuted them at a city park in Georgia. During football practice at Fleming park in Augusta on Monday, Melquan Robinson hopped a fence to retrieve a ball, WRDW reports, citing the incident report that says when he ""went to come back over the fence, he was electrocuted."" The seventh-grader was pronounced dead later at Children's Hospital of Georgia, according to the Augusta Chronicle. Two other boys who tried to help their friend were injured and hospitalized, according to reports. The mother of one of them, David Sette, tells WRDW that her son is improving. Per the Chronicle, an adult also was injured in the incident. ""We lost a future leader. We lost a future athlete. We lost a child in our city,"" Melquan's former coach, acting as a spokesman for the bereaved family, tells the Chronicle. The oldest of three children, Melquan loved his family and was very protective of his siblings, he says. Multiple investigations into the incident are reportedly underway, with city officials looking into how the fence became electrified. Georgia Power, offering ""condolences and sympathy,"" said in a statement that the utility ""does not control or maintain the voltage"" that caused the electrocution. Melquan's family will hold a vigil Thursday at the Bernie Ward Community Center. ""This young man was where he needed to be,"" his former coach says, per WRDW. ""He was doing what he loved.""

garcia reached twitter httptwittercomoskargarcia,"– After lawmakers approved gay marriage in Hawaii last month, the ceremonies have officially begun. The law went into effect last night at midnight, and six couples were quick to get hitched, the AP reports. At a Sheraton in Waikiki, those looking to tie the knot could join in a giant ceremony. ""We started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight,"" says an activist at the hotel. Indeed, Hawaii played a key role in the early gay marriage debate: When same-sex Hawaiian couples sought marriage licenses in the 1990s, a court battle ensued, resulting in the Defense of Marriage Act. In the state, couples can apply for a marriage license and get married in the same day. That could be a boon for destination weddings in a state already well-equipped for tourist ceremonies. A University of Hawaii researcher says the state could see a $217 million increase in tourism thanks to the process. NPR speaks with an Arkansas couple already planning a wedding trip. ""There's two things that came in effect when planning where we wanted to be married,"" says Cyrilla Owle. ""First, like any couple, we wanted to see where we wanted to go for our honeymoon. So who doesn't want to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, right? And the second reason was, where could we get a license?"""

slate facebook follow us twitter like this story,"– If you live in America, there’s a good chance you’re shoveling snow today—or will be soon—but beware: The dreaded chore can actually kill you. How to avoid such a tragic fate? Well, for starters, keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less. Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don’t start shoveling while snow is still falling (it’s colder, so you’ll put additional strain on your heart); don’t bundle up too much (getting too hot isn’t good, either); and don’t drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, “wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $20 or $30,” Noah recommends. “Delegate. The economy will benefit and your cardiologist will thank you.”"

the immersive 3d exhibition  tomb christ the church holy sepulchre experience open national geographic museum washington dc fall 2018,"– Millions of people flock to Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre each year. Many believe it to house the tomb of Jesus Christ, though scientists have thus far been unable to date the tomb to the time when the Romans built a church around it. Now, however, a new series of tests ""corroborates our historical accounts"" as a National Geographic writer puts it to NBC News. It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding—proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: ""While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ... [the] results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine."" (Scientists have issued a dire warning about the site.)"

It's not clear how bad the damage is to Le Marin, or The Sailor, or even how the damage occurred, but the auction house said in a statement that two outside conservators ""have made recommendations for the successful restoration of the painting,"" reports ABC News. One weird twist: The painting belongs to former casino mogul Steve Wynn, who previously had bad luck with a different Picasso painting. Back in 2006, Wynn stuck his elbow through Picasso's Le Reve while showing it to friends in his Las Vegas office, reports Bloomberg, which adds that Wynn has a disease that messes up his peripheral vision. That restoration had a happy ending: The painting had been valued at $139 million prior to the damage, and Wynn eventually sold it for $155 million. This hasn't been a stellar year for Wynn: He stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations."

grossman already donated 100000 dollars fire victims establishing sierra nevada camp fire relief fund supported golden valley bank community foundation the ipa released around first year,"– Breweries across the US are joining forces to raise money for those affected by the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history. More than 1,000 beermakers will brew batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, with 100% of the proceeds going to Camp Fire relief efforts, USA Today reports. The fundraiser is being spearheaded by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is headquartered in Chico, Calif., an area that was threatened by the Camp Fire, which burned more than 153,000 acres, destroyed some 19,000 buildings, and killed at least 85 people in Butte County earlier this month. Sierra Nevada brewed its batch of Resilience IPA on Tuesday, founder Ken Grossman said in a statement, and the brewer will make it available in late December. “We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we’re in this for the long haul,” Grossman says. “Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community’s future.” (Check out participating breweries here.) While the Camp Fire, which was fully contained as of Sunday, left the Sierra Nevada brewery unscathed, it did destroy the homes of 15% of the company’s employees, KRCR reports. Initially, the brewer was hoping to get 500 other breweries on board to make Resilience IPA, spokesman Robin Gregory says, adding that they have been “absolutely blown away” by the response. Overall, the company expects the effort to produce about 8.6 million pints. Resilience is described as a “classic” West Coast-style IPA (here’s the recipe for homebrewers). (This man handed out $1,000 checks to Camp Fire victims.)"
