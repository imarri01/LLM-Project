the Montgomery County Airpark in Gaithersburg, Maryland, crashed into a home this morning, engulfing that home in flames and setting two others on fire. Three people are dead, but the count could grow. A Montgomery County Fire rep says three fliers were killed in the crash, but notes the corporate plane may have had a fourth person on board, reports the AP. A relative of the owner of the home that was hit tells WUSA 9 that a mother with three children pre-school age and under should have been home at the time; there's no word on the family's whereabouts. The crash occurred around 11am on Drop Forge Lane, and the fire was extinguished within an hour. Crews are now searching the wreckage. A witness noted the plane appeared to ""wobble"" before the crash; the airport is no more than 3/4 mile from the crash scene. NTSB and FAA will investigate."

""Palin's popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander of Milfistan,"" he tweeted—and we probably don't need to tell you where that is. His first attempt at an apology, which he tweeted the next morning: ""Apparently Charlie Sheen got control of my Twitter account last night while I was at dinner. Apologies for his behavior.” That wasn't good enough for many conservative women, Politico notes, rounding up reactions from bloggers to Michelle Malkin calling his behavior sexist and misogynistic. By late Tuesday, Carlson had offered up a more sincere-sounding apology: “I’m sorry for last night’s tweet. I meant absolutely no offense. Not the first dumb thing I’ve said. Hopefully the last.” But at least one man—Erick Erickson, editor of RedState.com—was on Carlson's side, tweeting his reaction to the post in question: ""I laughed then got out my passport."""

Wrong. The correct answer is ""amateur testicle surgery."" The BBC reports 56-year-old Allan Matthews pleaded guilty Wednesday to removing another man's left testicle at an Australian motel despite not being qualified to practice medicine. The unsanctioned surgery took place in May after a 52-year-old man posted an ad online seeking help for a medical issue, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The man was apparently still suffering after being kicked in the groin by a horse years earlier but couldn't afford an actual doctor. A week after Matthews allegedly removed the man's testicle, infection set in. The man went to the hospital, and the police launched an investigation. Authorities say a raid of Matthews' home last month turned up medical equipment, seven guns, and four bottles of what may be amyl nitrate. In addition to performing surgery without being a doctor, Matthews also pleaded guilty to gun and drug charges. He did not plead guilty to inflicting ""reckless grievous bodily harm."" AAP reports Matthews is out on bail until another hearing next month. (An Oregon man claimed surgery left him with an 80-pound scrotum.)"

lifeline18002738255was pinned bottom memorial instagram posts shared tweets ran alongside news obituaries whenever,"– Calls to suicide hotlines have spiked dramatically since the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain—not an unusual phenomenon in the wake of celebrity suicides. The Wall Street Journal reports on a 25% uptick at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) since Spade's death, while USA Today attributed a similar rise to both celebs, and a New Jersey hotline experienced a 70% increase in calls Friday morning. ""We're so extremely busy,"" says Rachel Larkin, who heads a crisis-prevention center in Maryland. ""I think we’re all worried. ... Both Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain are people a lot of people related to."" Celebrity suicides have been linked to suicide increases before. Marilyn Monroe's 1962 death, for example, preceded a 12% spike in suicides nationwide, the Wrap reports. ""When people who have suicidal thoughts see seemingly happy, famous and wealthy people dying of suicide, it makes them feel more hopeless,"" says Lauren Foster, who heads a hotline in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""They think if they died, what’s to stop me?"" But suicide-prevention advocates are emphasizing that hotlines do help and people's calls will go through, despite the surge this week.

I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually.""—Tim Hunt, Nobel-winning scientist, after he made light of ""girls"" working in labs. He added that it was a ""stupid"" thing to say in front of journalists, which is partly why a writer at the Washington Post calls this the ""non-apology of the year."" New name, please: ""We are sorry that wording which could be considered offensive has been used, as this has not been our intention at all.""—Lego, after it described a strange-looking new Lego model as a ""window-licker,"" a derogatory term for people with learning disabilities. If it's on Facebook, it must be true: ""I want to apologize as well to all our listeners for having made an erroneous statement. I am sorry for the mistake. However, I am glad to play a role in putting this rumor to rest.""—Diane Rehm of NPR, after she informed Bernie Sanders that he had Israeli citizenship during an interview. He doesn't.

practice permitted students disabilities subjected corporal punishment higher rates students without them these data disparities shock conscience king wrote follow greg toppo twitter gtoppo read share story httpusatly2fmdlxh,"– Education Secretary John King has a message for states where physical discipline is permitted in schools, per USA Today: Quit it. In a letter to governors and state school chiefs, King says 22 states—mostly in the South and West—still allow corporal punishment or don't forbid it. He implores them to stop the ""harmful"" and ""ineffective"" practice, saying it teaches kids that getting physical is OK to solve problems. He also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings. About 80 groups—including the NAACP—lent their support to a similar letter penned Monday by the National Women's Law Center, reports CBS News. ""Corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it's time we do the same for our nation's schoolchildren,"" an NWLC rep says. King also notes that physical punishment isn't applied equitably to all students. For example, even though black students make up about 16% of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools, they're on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment. Boys are subjected to 80% of such acts, while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students. ""These data and disparities shock the conscience,"" King writes. (Alabama paddled 19K students in one school year.)"

2010 roy said when walk summit its tranquil said,"– A massive leak of fracking fluid poured into the streets of Arlington, Texas, two months ago and forced the evacuation of a hundred homes. Now city officials have taken Vantage Energy to task for its ""unacceptable"" handling of the 43,000-gallon spill, WFAA reports. During a city council meeting yesterday, it emerged that Vantage had taken nearly two hours to call 911 despite the risk of a gas leak. ""This is unacceptable behavior,"" says an Arlington city council member. According to Fire Chief Don Crowson, the two-hour delay was no joke: ""We’re not kidding around about the 911 issue,"" he tells the Star-Telegram during a break in city council. ""It could have ended in a bad outcome. Two hours’ advance notice could have helped a lot."" Still, officials say the environmental damage was not extensive and Vantage has been cooperative. So what happened, exactly? According to the city's report, a Vantage well site sprung a leak on April 11, which allowed fracking water and chemicals to boil up into Arlington's streets, storm sewers, and streams. Because the fracking fluid had been fracturing shale and freeing gas under high pressure, natural gas could have leaked at any time. Now WFAA says a 1,500-gallon spill occurred at the same location a month before, and NBC-Dallas/Fort Worth reports that the site is close to reopening. ""I just assumed this was a residential area and it would be free from industrial hazardous operations,"" says a resident after hearing about the earlier spill. ""Now we see it's not."""

He meets women online and invites them out to dinner. But here's where he allegedly diverges: According to CBS Los Angeles, 44-year-old Gonzales has been dining and dashing at area restaurants, leaving behind unsuspecting women he's asked out on blind dates. CBS reported in August that Gonzales had left two women to pay the bill after walking out on restaurant dates last summer. One of the women described how he'd eaten $100 worth of food at a restaurant in Long Beach—explaining he had to order two entrees because he's a bodybuilder—before saying he was going to the bathroom. She never saw him again. Now, the man Grub Street identifies as perhaps ""the world's worst dinner date"" appears to have struck again. A woman, identified by WTOL as Beth, says she met ""Dave Gonzales"" on Bumble before agreeing to dinner at a restaurant in Pasadena. Gonzales ordered ""a glass of pinot, a Caesar salad with a side of shrimp, a steak, and a baked potato"" and ate most of the meal before excusing himself to take a phone call, Beth says. He never returned, a text went unanswered, and his Bumble profile was later removed, adds Beth, who soon after learned of Gonzales' alleged notoriety. She says she wants his ""disgusting"" ruse to stop. According to police, Gonzales has also walked out of a salon, still clad in a smock, without paying for a haircut and color. He's wanted on two bench warrants as a result of misdemeanor charges, including petty theft. (This blind date was more shocking.)"

Trouble is, one of them is dead, reports E! Online. In a bizarre video posted to YouTube yesterday, a bare-chested Stern plops an ice cube into a shot glass of water, then pours it over his head, immediately succumbing to mock shivers before hopping off camera. But first he challenges the very much alive Barbara Walters and Mark Consuelos, plus the quite dead Casey Kasem, to douse themselves with ice water next. Stern is aware of Kasem's death at age 82, E! notes, as he's discussed it on his radio show."

charles,"– Anyone whose luggage has been lost by an airline now has a patron saint in the form of Justice Peter Smith in Britain. When lawyers for British Airways showed up in his court to argue a $4.6 billion price-fixing case, Smith had smaller fish to fry: He wanted to know why the airline lost his luggage on a recent trip to Italy, reports the Legal Cheek blog. The questioning of BA counsel Jon Turner is priceless, as relayed by the Independent: ""Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage?” When Turner replies that they're actually in court for a different matter, Smith won't be put off: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?” Turner again tries to deflect the questioning, but Smith responds, “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question: namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now."" This goes on for a while, and the BA lawyers ask Smith to recuse himself from the case they're supposed to be arguing because he's biased. Smith reluctantly agrees to do so. Entertaining yes, but whether it was good judgeship remains to be seen—the Times of London reports that judicial conduct authorities are investigating. The same judge once inserted a secret message (""Smithy Code"") into his ruling in a copyright case involving the Da Vinci Code, notes the Telegraph. (If you'd like to be berated by an American judge, try this.)"

owner-driver Teodulo Elias Vides hadn't been one of 13 people killed in a horrific crash on Interstate 10 near Palm Springs, Calif., on Sunday, authorities would probably have some tough questions for him. Authorities say half the tires on the bus he was driving, including both steer axle tires, were worn down to an unsafe level, which would have been enough for inspectors to take the bus out of service, the AP reports. The bus, which was on its way to Los Angeles from the Red Earth Casino in Salton Sea Beach, plowed into the back of a big rig and it's not clear whether Vides attempted to brake first. The full National Transportation Safety Board investigation could take up to a year. Vides, 59, had been sued twice for negligence over incidents involving his USA Holiday company, which is listed as having just one bus, the Los Angeles Times reports. In a 2007 incident, three people died when a USA Holiday bus hit a Honda Civic on a freeway in Riverside, Calif. The company also received at least six ""unsatisfactory"" ratings from the California Highway Patrol for issues including maintenance, and Vides had several traffic citations on his record. The victims, whose ages range from 50 to 72, were mostly seated near the front of the bus, reports the Press Enterprise. Another 31 people were injured."

they'd be yelling ""Doh!"" last night were ranting ""Dud!"" this morning. Viewers had been warned for months that what was rumored to be a major character would be killed off during the premiere of the show's 26th season last night, the Los Angeles Times reports. There was a character who kicked the cartoon bucket, but it wasn't exactly a major one: It was Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, Krusty the Clown's dad, voiced by comedian Jackie Mason, a character that only appeared in ""a handful"" of episodes, the Times notes. Reaction to the ""Clown in the Dumps"" episode ranged from mild, NPR-style disappointment to outright irritation: Tim Donnelly writes in the New York Post that the death (and preceding teasers) were ""a lame play for attention by a show desperate to stay relevant."" One Twitter user quoted in the Times complained, ""Krusty's dad died... Um, Krusty had a Dad? Never heard of him. Wasted anticipation."" Producer Al Jean insists he has always said the untimely death was ""overhyped"" and that he never promised it would be one of the more-popular characters. ""I never said it’s an iconic character—I never used those words,"" he tells Entertainment Weekly. In fact, he assures fans that favorites will never be purposely annihilated before series' end. ""We're never going to kill off Homer, or even Krusty,"" he tells TVLine. ""This show is always running in syndication, and we don't want you to feel bad every time you see an old character that you loved."""

policy, but that doesn't mean it can't sell weapons directly to Taiwan, citing ithe Taiwan Relations Act to ensure Taiwan can adequately defend itself—and China isn't happy about it. The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and ""severely"" damages China's sovereignty. ""China's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies,"" a ministry spokesman says. A Pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll Wednesday, per the New York Times, noting, ""The Chinese can react to this as they see fit. … It's a [clear-eyed], sober view of an assessment of Taiwan's defense needs. … There's no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with China."" Meanwhile, the AP notes that China has issued similar threats before, with ""no evidence they've had any meaningful effect."" (All this despite a lengthy handshake last month.)"

They're ""extremely unlikely"" to accept the proposal without ""specific access to information"" on Holmes that, so far, his team has refused to provide, they say, per the Denver Post. What's more, ""there is not—and has never been—an actual or unqualified 'offer' to plead guilty,"" prosecutors wrote in an angry filing yesterday accusing Holmes' team of a misleading publicity stunt. The prosecutors' filing, signed by district attorney George Brauchler himself rather than a deputy, also took issue with defense suggestions about a lengthy series of pretrial hearings, among other concerns. Brauchler accused the defense of ""an attempt to deliberately prejudice the public, witnesses, and victims against the People."" Meanwhile, he called on the judge to reject a defense motion calling for action against the prosecution for allegedly leaking information to the press. Brauchler is poised to announce whether he'll seek the death penalty on Monday."

One of your vices could one day be a little more virtuous: Scientists are today announcing that they've figured out how to make chocolate healthier. The findings will be detailed by researchers from Belgium's Ghent University and the University of Ghana at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is. As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process. Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted. It's during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost. In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that ""makes our research fundamentally different,"" explains Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa: pulp preconditioning. That simply means they stored the pods—in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days—before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process. A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and Afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans. Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting—which they also adjusted. Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity. The researchers' abstract notes another benefit: ""Pulp preconditioning and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness,"" improving chocolate's flavor.

forward working president entire team its going great 2019,"– If you've ever called your boss a ""terrible human being,"" it turns out you sort of have something in common with the president's next acting chief of staff. Mick Mulvaney, who was named as John Kelly's replacement on Friday, used those choice words in reference to Donald Trump one week before the 2016 election. Politico reports Mulvaney was up for re-election in the House (he won), and referred to Trump and Hillary Clinton during a South Carolina debate as ""perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country"" when asked whether he was throwing his support behind the GOP candidate. He zeroed in on Trump specifically, saying ""Do I like Donald Trump? No"" and noting he didn't see Trump as a role model for his sons. And there's this: ""Yes, I am supporting Donald Trump, but I’m doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that I think he’s a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad."" USA Today reports it was only hours after the Mulvaney news broke on Friday that the Daily Beast posted video of those comments. Mulvaney himself had more positive words on Friday, tweeting, ""This is a tremendous honor. I look forward to working with the President and the entire team. It’s going to be a great 2019!"" (Mulvaney will hold onto his other jobs in the administration.)"

Specifically, the North is warning of ""surgical strikes at any time"" and a ""precision nuclear striking tool"" that will seek to ""advance our long-cherished wish for national reunification,"" reports the AP. The US-China deal is aimed at punishing Pyongyang over February's nuclear test, in a joint deal that heads to the UN Security Council today. In addition to new sanctions—whose specifics aren't yet known—the planned resolution enforces current ones, the Wall Street Journal reports. Right now, sanctions include a ban on ballistic missile and nuclear tests and a ban on the import of arms and luxury goods; some in the country face financial and travel restrictions, and the new measures could expand them. China was expected, however, to refuse an oil embargo, believing that such a blow to the North Korean economy could bring refugees to China. The sanctions deal is expected to be adopted this week, says a diplomat."

international trade commission washington to contact reporter story susan decker washington sdecker1bloombergnet to contact editor responsible story bernard kohn bkohn2bloombergnet,"– A big win for Samsung in its long-running patent feud with Apple: The US International Trade Commission has banned imports of the AT&T models of older Apple products including the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 3G after deciding Apple violated a Samsung patent, the Wall Street Journal reports. Newer Apple products like the iPhone 5 are not affected by the ruling, which Apple says it is ""disappointed"" by and will appeal. The ruling will take effect in 60 days unless it is vetoed by President Obama, a move analysts say is nearly as unlikely as the two companies deciding to settle their difference amicably. ""There’s too much skin in the game now,"" a spokesman for technology research firm IDC tells Bloomberg. ""It’s almost so ugly I don’t think they’ll come to any agreement. Both companies have a lot of cash and are generating a lot of money. It’s not like they have to worry about paying the legal bills."""

headline in Der Spiegel puts it. Hans Riegel, who ran Germany's Haribo candy company and made the chewy little bears a worldwide phenomenon, has died at age 90. The bears were a concoction of his father, the founder of Haribo, but it was the younger Riegel whose deft marketing turned them into a global hit. (Gummi trivia: The jellied bears were originally made of licorice, notes the New York Times.) Riegel and his brother first sold them as ""gold bears"" in 1960s before changing the name. They introduced them throughout Europe in the 1970s and then set up Haribo of America in Baltimore in the early 1980s. It all paid off: Forbes says the company's revenues are north of $3 billion today. ""I just wanted to make something of my father's life work,"" Riegel once said."

catholic church work general assignment reporter two months returning role columnist he also barred giving outside broadcast interviews six months time appearances face heightened editorial scrutiny statement said,"– The Boston Globe has suspended columnist Kevin Cullen without pay for three months after inconsistencies were found in his remarks following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Per the AP, newspaper publisher John Henry and editor Brian McGrory announced Friday an independent review found Cullen likely fabricated some anecdotes he shared in interviews after the bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds more. The review also noted an uncorrected error in one of Cullen's marathon bombing columns but didn't find signs of fabrication in other works. Cullen, who was part of the Globe team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2014, didn't immediately comment, but Henry and McGrory say he has apologized. Cullen has been on paid leave since April, when Boston sports radio station WEEI noted inconsistencies in Cullen's work and the paper launched its investigation. Per the New York Times, Cullen described in an interview the tale of a firefighter he claimed to have spoken with. He said the firefighter described rescuing a 7-year-old girl whose lower leg had been blown off. However, the firefighter denied having ever spoken to Cullen. The Times also says Cullen, while speaking on a panel in 2013, claimed he witnessed a firefighter outside a bar on the phone with a fellow firefighter, who was apparently traumatized by the bombing, to come out for the night. The Globe has called the account ""problematic"" and calls into question whether it occurred at all. ""Our review also leads us to believe that Mr. Cullen did not commit irrevocable damage,"" the Globe said in a statement Saturday. ""He has also acknowledged his failures and the issues they have created."""

guilty in the 2006 slaying of 48-year-old Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, whose investigative reporting criticized President Vladimir Putin, the war in Chechnya, and Chechen leadership. Three of the men are brothers from Chechnya, one of whom has been found guilty of the shooting itself, which NBC News reports took place ""execution-style"" in the elevator of her apartment building. The other two brothers were found guilty of tracking Politkovskaya and acting as getaway drivers, and their uncle and a retired police officer were found to have organized and prepared for the murder, respectively. All face life in prison. Three of the conspirators now convicted were acquitted in 2009, but a retrial was ordered. Another ex-cop was convicted of supplying the murder weapon last year, the BBC reports. The defendants' lawyers plan to appeal the convictions, Reuters reports. Politkovskaya’s family is disappointed that it's still not clear who ordered the killing, saying in a statement that the men convicted ""are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice."" Though an investigation into the murder continues, critics suggest the mastermind will never be found because, as Reuters puts it, ""the trail could lead too close to the government""—Politkovskaya's work angered quite a few important people."

competitiveness problems weak growth unfortunately solutions problems impact longer term until portuguese hard road ahead additional reporting andrei khalip lisbon editing andrew torchia,"– Portugal is biting the bullet and admitting that it desperately needs a massive bailout from its European Union partners to stay afloat. Caretaker prime minister Jose Socrates told the nation that the decision to seek a bailout was ""a last resort"" as interest rates on its short-term debt skyrocket, reports the Guardian. Analysts believe the bailout will cost the EU some $114 billion. Portugal, which will have to commit to an economic adjustment program in exchange for the funds, joins Ireland and Greece on the eurozone's casualty list. The bailout request was widely expected, and analysts see it as a positive move because it will prevent a Portuguese collapse that could have made Spain the next target for markets searching for signs of weakness. ""This is good news. We've been saying for a while that Portugal's finances were not sustainable at these rates,"" a Goldman Sachs economist tells Reuters. ""We think the contagion stops here."""

limbo in the ""berm""—what the Guardian describes as the ""no-man's land"" at the border between Jordan and Syria. And since June of this year, those refugees have been living in what Doctors Without Borders has called ""some of the most extreme conditions on Earth,"" enduring temperatures over the summer that surpassed 120 degrees Fahrenheit and watching humanitarian supplies and food come to a halt in June after Jordan cut off deliveries following a car bomb. But government spokesman Mohammad Momani told the Jordan Times on Sunday that while the borders remain sealed, a new method of delivery will be used: cranes that will lower the goods from the northeastern side of the border to the other side (there was a one-off delivery like this in August). And it sounds like the aid is coming just in time. Per the AP, the refugees are living in tents and suffering not only from hunger and exposure to the elements, but also from serious illness, including whooping cough and hepatitis. Last month, Amnesty International released chilling video footage and satellite images that showed graves and burial mounds in the berm, per the Washington Post. ""Many people have died,"" a refugee living in one of the camps told the group, saying conditions were ""awful."" ""The mood among the people … is below zero."" Two anonymous aid officials tell the news agency there's been no final confirmation, but Momani says the plans are being put in place to expedite the deliveries. ""The aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,"" he says, noting the aid groups will make the call on the pace of the deliveries.

congress performed behalf the united states national archives  records,"– To anyone born after 1995, the floppy disk is better known as that thing that resembles the ""save"" icon. To the Pentagon, it's the gizmo that controls America's nukes. A report from the Government Accountability Office finds US government agencies spend $60 billion a year operating and maintaining outdated systems—three times more than is spent on upgrades, per CNN. One such system: the Pentagon's IBM Series-1 computer which uses 8-inch floppy disks ""in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces,"" including intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers. For youngsters, the big floppy disks were the precursor to the 3.5-inch ones, before the CD came around. ""This system remains in use because, in short, it still works,"" a Pentagon rep tells the AFP, per the BBC, which notes you'd need 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to get the storage capacity of a 32GB memory stick. ""However, to address obsolescence concerns, the floppy drives are scheduled to be replaced with secure digital devices by the end of 2017,"" the rep says. Other system upgrades are expected by 2020. ""Maybe we'll have Nintendo Gameboys controlling our nukes by the next presidential election,"" quips CNN's Jake Tapper. The Treasury, Commerce, and Veteran Affairs departments should also look into upgrading. The report finds all three use computer code introduced in the 1950s, per the Verge. (Floppy disks are partly to blame for lost scientific data.)"

Hundreds more cases are reported throughout Europe. The source: Germany blames cucumbers from Spain, specifically the Almeria and Malaga regions. A third batch from the Netherlands or Denmark is under investigation. Spain angrily denies being the source, and EU officials say the vegetables could have become tainted anywhere along the supply chain. The fallout: Russia has banned some imports from Spain and Germany (and may expand it to all EU nations); Italy, Austria, and other nations have stopped short of that but are ramping up inspections at supermarkets."

relatively small scale study results indicate ways interact social media affect feel always positively,"– Teens aren't necessarily as in love with social media as they're portrayed to be. The results of an AP poll released last week show that nearly 60% of teens in the US have taken social media breaks—most of the time voluntary ones that last at least a week. Now researchers at the University of South Wales have presented findings to the British Psychological Society that suggest even what are perceived to be straightforward perks of social media—such as getting attention via likes—may not exactly elevate the end user's mood. ""Although this is just a relatively small-scale study, the results indicate that the ways we interact with social media can affect how we feel, and not always positively,"" one researcher says. To test this, the team reports in a Science Daily news release that it recruited 340 participants on Twitter and Facebook to complete personality questionnaires and then agree or disagree with 25 statements. Key findings include that people who go out of their way to rack up more likes tend to have low self-esteem and be less trusting of others, and that those likes don't actually lift their mood or how they see themselves. Previous research has looked not at more likes, but at more time, reports Medical Daily. It cites a study published in 2016 that surveyed 19- to 32-year-olds and found ""individuals in the highest quartile of [social media] site visits per week ... had significantly increased odds of depression."" (Young people average at least an hour a day on social media.)"

Now a quasi-official North Korean news agency has posted a new video—this one of the US Capitol exploding, NBC News reports. Intercut with images of North Korean artillery and missiles, the video also shows a target homing in on the White House. ""The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a long-range missile,"" reads a caption. ""This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow."" The video comes after months of alarming moves by Pyongyang. The North has tested a rocket and a nuclear weapon, threatened to nuke the US, and announced the end of the armistice that has kept peace on the Korean peninsula. One analyst blames the escalation on new leader Kim Jong Un's need to ""prove himself"" to North Korea's military: ""My take is that it is overwhelmingly bluster for domestic reasons, not international ones,"" she says.

The 83-year-old surgeon's award-winning 1994 book on death argued that death with dignity was rare and doctors too often tried to prolong life when further treatment was futile, the New York Times reports. ""I have not seen much dignity in the process by which we die,"" he wrote. ""The quest to achieve true dignity fails when our bodies fail."" In a 1996 interview, he said he hoped he would go ""without suffering and surrounded by loved ones"" when it was his time. His daughter says he often spoke to his family about his illness and impending death and while he was very much at peace most of the time, there were times of sadness and fear toward the end. ""He wasn’t scared of death itself, but he loved everything about his world and the people in his world and life,” she tells the AP. ""And he didn’t want to leave."""

Thanks to the ""Me Too"" and ""Time's Up"" movements, gender equality is gaining new awareness in the workplace, and now perhaps in your whisky: TMZ reports that Diageo, parent company of the Johnnie Walker brand, put in the paperwork earlier this month for a Jane Walker trademark that would cover a bevy of unspecified beverages. A post at Drampedia notes that labels bearing the name ""Jane Walker Edition"" have turned up, but no details are available on any new products. ""Whether it’s Johnnie’s sister or not will be revealed in due time,"" per the post. It appears this isn't the first time the female-monikered concept, which TMZ assumes will focus on ""gender equality and female empowerment,"" has been broached by Diageo. Adweek noted right after the 2016 presidential election that a Jane Walker ad campaign was in the works, but it was apparently nixed after Hillary Clinton lost, sources said at the time."

Vega was six months pregnant, and loved ones described her to Tucson News Now as “kind, compassionate, and so excited to be a mom.” No other other occupants were injured during the shooting. Authorities say multiple gunshots were fired toward the home from outside, and that there were several bullet holes found in the walls, but it is still unknown whether the gunfire was targeted specifically at anyone in the household. Tucson police are asking for anyone with information to come forward. “You can remain anonymous,” they said on Facebook. (Three St. Louis women were killed as they tried to escape a home invasion.)"

eating tail its tail head virtually disappeared one another,"– The body of a 19-year-old U of Penn student was found last month in a California park, and as details of Blaze Bernstein's murder continue to emerge, so, too, does a disturbing picture of suspected killer Sam Woodward, 20, and the white supremacist group he's said to belong to. ProPublica dives deep into Atomwaffen Division (""Atomwaffen"" means ""nuclear weapons"" in German), whose internal message boards lit up after Bernstein's killing. Members both celebrated Woodward as a ""one man gay Jew wrecking crew"" and raged that one of their own may have leaked Woodward's AWD affiliation. Although the group is open about their hatred of minorities, Jews, and gays—and their love of Hitler and Charles Manson—it's a notoriously secretive bunch that doesn't take kindly to ""rats and traitors."" ProPublica got its hands on about 250,000 AWD messages from encrypted logs on Discord, a chat platform meant for gamers but popular with white supremacist groups, with startling revelations. The messages offer a frightening glimpse into the group's leaders, where members are located (as many as 20 cells may exist in several US states), and what ""potential targets"" may be, including water and electric utilities. ""We haven't seen anything like Atomwaffen in quite a while,"" a Southern Poverty Law Center researcher says. ""They should be taken seriously because they're so extreme."" Others, though, think while some members may be dangerous, most just indulge in ""magical thinking"" about government overthrows and spend their time reading fascist lit. ""It's very hard to go from talking about violence to looking a guy in the eyes and killing him,"" one expert says. ProPublica's in-depth take also includes details on AWD's supposed leader, who goes by the nickname ""Rape,"" and the ire ProPublica itself received after it tied Woodward to AWD in a Jan. 26 article. ""We really owe those jews at ProPublica,"" one member wrote in a chat message. More on AWD here."

Journalists toned down the controversy this time around—not. In fact, right on the cover, a Muslim is planting a big, slobbery kiss on a figure representing the publication, Charlie Hebdo. Above the embrace are the words: ""Love is stronger than hate."" The Guardian says the paper ""isn't holding back,"" while Gawker—convinced the Muslim is a ""gay Mohammad"" (though he's not in the garb of the prophet)—calls it the ""ballsiest paper in the world."" Charlie Hebdo's editor said after the firebombing that ""freedom to have a good laugh is as important as freedom of speech."" The French, including some Muslim leaders, have strongly supported the publication, which is now operating out of the offices of the left-wing Paris newspaper Liberation. ""I am extremely attached to the freedom of the press, even if the press is not always tender with Muslims, Islam, or the Paris Mosque,"" said the head of the Paris Mosque."

of this morning, 100 of the 183 people hospitalized in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing have been released, CNN reports, in a testament to how well area doctors have handled the crisis. Boston boasts nearly 80 hospitals, and they're regarded as some of the world's best, the Week points out, while MSNBC observes that trauma treatment has improved drastically since 9/11—in part because of America's war experience. The Marathon bombs were IEDs, ""and that's exactly what a number of our troops in Iraq in Afghanistan have had to deal with,"" one emergency room specialist tells NPR. Techniques learned in those conflicts have now proliferated into civilian medicine. Tourniquets, for instance, have gone from being considered a dangerous last resort to a routine life-saver. Shrapnel extraction techniques have improved as well. It also helped that there was a medical tent at the finish line already, which quickly became a well-oiled triage center. ""I've seen a lot worse,"" one emergency room physician tells the New York Times. ""They were without question ready—not for those types of injuries, but they were prepared."""

Adult supervision, check. She should have been safe, but a freak accident in a New Jersey lagoon took the life of an 11-year-old girl over the weekend. Police say the girl was electrocuted while swimming and playing on an inflatable raft behind a friend’s home in Toms River, reports the Asbury Park Press. The girl was with two friends when the incident occurred, and they were all wearing life vests as they swam and rafted in the lagoon under adult supervision, reports PIX11. A police statement says that after the girls touched the rail to a metal boat lift, an ""electric current appears to have energized the equipment causing the injury."" The girl was administered CPR on the scene, but died later at the hospital. It's not the first time such an accident has been in the news this year. Following the April death of Alabama teen Carmen Johnson, who was shocked while swimming near her family's boathouse, CBS News explained that small levels of electric current in water can serve as a “silent killer,” especially in fresh water, where voltage can “take a shortcut” through bodies. And two more Alabama women are also believed to have been shocked to death in lake water, reports AL.com. The Electric Shock Drowning Prevention Association advises against swimming in or near docks, marinas, and boatyards, while the parents of Johnson offered more tips on TODAY, like using plastic over metal ladders and making sure there is a ground fault breaker at docks."

polling stations continue open fire civilians country credibility eyes world mr hague said,"– Syria's new constitution was backed by more than 89% of voters, the nation's Interior Ministry announced today, even as violence continues to rage across the country and the West decries the referendum as a sham. The Interior Ministry claims that more than 57% of Syria's 14 million eligible voters turned out, with about 9% voting no and 1.6% of the ballots being rejected as spoiled. The New York Times notes that the Syrian government controlled the voting, but may not have needed to manipulate the results, considering that much of the opposition boycotted the referendum. Across the nation, 33 people were killed today, many of them in continued government shelling in Homs, and 55 people died yesterday. The European Union has imposed new sanctions in the face of the continuing violence, CNN reports. Seven ministers of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, as well as the Syrian Central Bank, will have their EU assets frozen. The ministers will also be denied entry into the EU and Syrian cargo flights will not be allowed to use EU airports. Says the EU foreign policy chief in a statement, ""As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions."""

Early Monday, the Florida 8-year-old was pronounced dead after months of medical issues related to the tragic stunt. Ki'ari underwent emergency surgery to clear scar tissue on her windpipe so she could breathe; after the tracheotomy, she continued to have difficulty breathing (requiring two trips to the ER) and also talking. She had a doctor's appointment set for Friday to be checked. But on Sunday night, she told her mother's boyfriend she was struggling to breathe; she lost consciousness within minutes and was pronounced dead about an hour later, at 12:15am Monday, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The Medical Examiner's Office is still determining Ki'ari's cause of death, and Florida's Department of Children and Families is investigating the incident. There have been at least 10 other DCF cases related to the family since 2008, the Palm Beach Post reports, five of them involving alleged domestic violence between Ki'ari's mother and her boyfriend; it's not clear whether the boyfriend who called 911 after Ki'ari lost consciousness is the same one from those reports. At least one of the DCF cases resulted in verified proof of abuse or neglect, but details aren't available.

emergencyincidents laverton6440 first posted,"– Police searching for a 62-year-old man who disappeared in Australia's Outback on Wednesday say the grandfather has miraculously been found alive. Reg Foggerdy had been last seen near a campsite on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia while on a hunting trip with his brother, reports the Guardian. He had left to shoot a feral camel but never returned, adds the BBC. Though an experienced bushman, he was wearing only a T-shirt, shorts, hat, and flip-flops and had no food or water, police say. Police began a land and air search after discovering a camel carcass and finally discovered fresh tracks on Monday, reports the West Australian. Foggerdy was found ""extremely dehydrated, a bit delusional,"" under a tree Tuesday morning about 9 miles from his last known location. ""He's received treatment, first aid on the ground, and it's fair to say he's now sitting up and talking,"" officer Andy Greatwood tells ABC Radio, adding Foggerdy's ""fantastic survival skills"" kept him alive when ""most people would not have survived."" After walking for miles, Foggerdy had spent his last two days in the Outback ""lying down under a tree and eating black ants,"" Greatwood says. Foggerdy's wife, Erlyn, says he may have picked up that tip from a jungle survival show he liked to watch every day, reports PerthNow. Foggerdy's 11-year-old son says he initially wasn't too concerned when his father didn't return to camp, but ""when he was lost for a few more days I started getting worried. I'm so happy they found him."" Family members add they'll now force Foggerdy, who's recovering in a hospital, to carry a satellite phone. (A dad's survival tip kept this lost boy alive.)"

In a paper published in Science today, researchers detail how they examined the blood of more than 750 children in Tanzania. They found that about 6% of those children had an antibody against one of the disease's key proteins, and that those children didn't suffer from severe malaria. Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, Paul Rodgers at Forbes explains. Until now, most malaria vaccines have focused on keeping the disease out of the red blood cells it reproduces in. But this antibody is unique in that it instead attacks the protein that allows the parasite to escape the cells. ""We're sort of trapping the parasite in the burning house,"" says co-lead author Jonathan Kurtis—who suffered his own bout of malaria while studying in Kenya while in college, NPR reports. The team believes this approach could work in concert with existing vaccines. It's a refreshing, promising idea, one Harvard doctor says, though she cautions that ""this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans."" It's been trialed in mice and will soon be tested on monkeys."

time going run out,"– If New York investigators are right, Richard Matt and David Sweat are probably sleeping right now—but they'll wake soon and continue picking their way through the woods and back roads toward Canada when darkness falls. At an update today on the hunt for the prison escapees, authorities say they're now pretty sure the men are trying to make the border, reports NBC News. ""Based on what we know at this point, we have a high degree of confidence in our conclusion,"" says Maj. Charles Guess of the state police. Guess didn't provide specifics, but he said investigators found ""significant"" items from the men in a cabin and in a field in the town of Malone yesterday and this morning, reports AP. They've shifted their search accordingly in a bid to head the men off. Matt and Sweat have eluded capture for three weeks now, which is impressive, but it doesn't protect them from this damning stat cited by the Atlantic: More than 92% of escapees from medium- and high-security prisons are caught within a year. Their odds improve somewhat if they make it past a month, however. The search update comes after a second prison worker was charged in the escape. (He once likened the inmates at his prison in Dannemora to caged ""puppies."")"

Darrell Issa is proposing a bill that would ""create a two-year moratorium on any new laws, rules, or regulations governing the Internet,"" reports CNN. It's been met with some controversy from fellow politicians and the public alike. The bill could block regulations that protect consumer privacy, says one lawmaker, and may stymie President Obama's efforts to bolster cybersecurity, reports The Hill. Issa is hosting a Q&A on Reddit today to discuss his bill, and plans to adjust it after receiving feedback. A separate battle is happening in Washington over the 'Do Not Track' initiative, which aims to give Internet users the ability to stop the collection of personal information for advertising purposes. It's a tough topic, since online ads are what pay for many free services, reports the Washington Post. The initiatives looked set to move forward after a successful White House event in February, but since then talks have grown bitter, in part due to opposition from advertising groups. The co-chair of the committee working on the initiative announced she'd be stepping down today, which could help revive talks."

The privately held company said Tuesday that its revenue dropped 5% to $2.4 billion in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of weakness in established markets like the US and Europe. Profits slipped 3% to $544 million. ""We are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this,"" said Chairman Joergen Vig Knudstorp, per the AP. He said the long-term aim is to reach ""more children in our well-established markets in Europe and the United States,"" and added there were ""strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as China."" The company, he said, needs to simplify its business model to reduce costs, though details weren't immediately available on what that might mean. Since 2012, the group has built an increasingly complex organization to support global double-digit growth. However, ""in the process, we have added complexity into the organization which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further,"" Vig Knudstorp said. The company has been lauded for embracing the digital era through smartphone apps and tie-ins with movies and video games, notes Reuters. The maker of the famous colored building blocks has more than 19,000 employees around the world."

frequent destination guiding trips ability members equally enter country currently uncertain statement read,"– There will be no new trips to the Washington Monument for students within Canada's largest school system. The Toronto District School Board, which includes 245,000 students in 584 schools, will no longer green-light trips south of the border, citing uncertainty over border restrictions. ""We strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border"" in light of President Trump's proposed travel restrictions, TDSB Director of Education John Malloy says, per the Toronto Star. Some 25 trips involving 900 students already scheduled for the spring will go on as planned to prevent financial loss, but the board says all students will turn back if any one student is refused entry into the US. Should Trump's executive order banning travelers from six countries ""be fully implemented, resulting in any of our students being excluded from trips across the US border,"" those trips will be cancelled outright, Malloy says, per CTV News. ""It's not about politics, it's about our principles as a school board to be inclusive and equitable,"" adds a TDSB rep. The Greater Essex County School Board in southwestern Ontario cited similar reasons when banning trips to the US for the month of February. Toronto’s Ryerson University has halted trips until further notice, as have the Girl Guides of Canada, the Canadian version of the Girl Scouts, per CNN. Other school boards say they could follow in the TDSB's footsteps ""if travel advisories change."""

commandos who tried to rescue American Luke Somers in Yemen came agonizingly close to doing so, according to an account in the Wall Street Journal. It says that about 40 special-ops troops got to within 100 yards of the walled compound in silence about 1am local time. Then, ""a noise, maybe a dog bark, alerted the militants to the raiders,"" writes Adam Entous, who spoke to US officials familiar with the rescue attempt. A 30-minute firefight ensued, during which officials think a militant from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula slipped into the building where Somers was being held and shot him and South African hostage Pierre Korkie. The US troops killed about 10 militants and managed to escape with the two wounded hostages, but one died in the military aircraft carrying him away and the other died on an operating table. ""The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,"" said President Obama, as per Reuters. Obama approved the raid, the second in two weeks to try to free Somers, after AQAP promised to kill the photojournalist later today."

The Glee actress met Matthew Paetz on the set of one of her music videos in April, and she's reportedly been seeing him, quietly, for a couple months. ""For a long time, Lea wasn't close to even thinking about getting into a relationship,"" a source tells People. ""Cory's death was and will continue to be a struggle for her."" Paetz is an aspiring actor and model, People notes, and on his Twitter account he describes himself as a dating and lifestyle coach—but TMZ says he is, or was, also a gigolo who went by the name ""Christian"" on Cowboys4Angels, a site offering male ""companionship"" that's featured on Showtime's Gigolos. TMZ has a screenshot of ""Christian's"" profile, which described him as a life coach, dating expert, and massage therapist who charged $350 per hour or $6,000 per weekend, but the gossip site says the profile is now hidden or removed. Sources say Paetz last took a client in April, but has taken a break since he and Michele got together. She was apparently unhappy after TMZ's gigolo story, the site notes in a follow-up, but sources say Paetz told her he really just coaches gigolos, and had only gone out with a few clients, for research purposes. But a TMZ source says Paetz had been working as an escort for nearly a year, and had gone on more than a few outings. But Michele ""feels he's a great guy,"" another source tells E!. ""He treats her really well, he's smart and fun. She's really happy."""

wwwcloseronlinecouk,"– An aspiring model and former escort in Britain says she won't be selling tickets to her baby's birth after all, and has decided to quit smoking and drinking—all because she found out she was having a girl, not a boy. Josie Cunningham, dubbed ""Britain's most hated woman,"" now says she's ""ashamed"" of her plans to offer tickets to the birth at around $66,000 a pop and charge Skype viewers $330 to watch via livestream, reports the Daily Mirror. At least four people had paid an apparently reduced price of $15,000 each per ticket, according to the Daily News. Why else don't the Brits like her? She had a breast augmentation paid for by the public health system, and told the Mirror earlier this year that she was being considered for Big Brother and would abort her baby if it would help her chances. Then she apparently got upset upon learning that her baby would be another boy (she already has two sons). So she coped by drinking and smoking, until doctors said last week that the baby will actually be a girl. ""I have been such a silly girl and have lots of regrets,"" Cunningham says. ""I can see that now I know I am going to have a daughter."""

 transportation  infrastructure,"– Obama fans might take heart. The man they wanted to show up at last night's debate finally surfaced at a rally in Denver today. Stories are using words like ""feistier"" (Washington Post), ""aggressive"" (the AP), ""coming out swinging"" (the Hill), and ""fired up"" (Politico) to describe the president's speech. Some examples: That ""very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney"" last night must have been an imposter, said Obama, because ""the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country all year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy, but the fellow onstage last night did not know anything about that."" ""The Mitt Romney we all know invested in companies that were pioneers in outsourcing. But the guy onstage last night said he doesn’t even know about laws that encourage offshoring."" “I mean thank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on Big Bird. It’s about time. We didn’t know that Big Bird was driving the federal deficit. But that’s what we heard last night. Elmo, too?"" “Gov. Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth."" The Romney camp dismissed it all as ""damage control."" The president adjusted to the altitude, apparently?"

among authorities cites fact chinese flag hoisted islands 1911 vietnamese school textbook 1974 allegedly referred paracels chinese,"– The dispute between China and Vietnam, fueled by the contentious location of a Chinese oil rig, is heating up: Now China is accusing Vietnamese ships of ramming its vessels well over a thousand times during the last month, the BBC reports. ""As of 5pm on 7 June, there were as many as 63 Vietnamese vessels in the area at the peak ... ramming the Chinese government ships for a total of 1,416 times,"" China says in a statement, which notes the ramming began shortly after it moved the rig on May 2. And the country is defending that movement to a spot that it says ""falls well within China's sovereignty and jurisdiction."" China's drilling is occurring far closer to its own islands, the Paracels, than to Vietnam's mainland, China claims. Trouble is, Vietnam also claims the Paracel Islands. Among China's justifications for its claim: It raised a flag on the islands in 1911, and a 1974 Vietnamese 9th-grade textbook allegedly says they're Chinese, the BBC notes. For its part, Vietnam last week called on the US to ""make further practical acts"" to settle the disagreements ""in accordance with international law."""

phones and operating system is now complete. One of the biggest shockers from the event: Research in Motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as BlackBerry. Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the ""heartfelt and brutal honesty"" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers ""that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,"" reports USA Today. The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports. The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier. The phones will be available tomorrow in the UK, but the US will have to cool its heel until March."

competition with Netflix: The latter has House of Cards, and now Amazon has its own original series set in DC ... with ""House"" in the title. Alpha House was created by Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who also writes the series about four Republican senators living together. The pilot (which features cameos by Bill Murray and Stephen Colbert) went online a month ago, along with 13 others, and Amazon looked at customer feedback to determine which to pick up for a full season. Alpha House was one of just two comedy pilots to make the cut. The Washington Post describes Alpha House as ""political satire"" in which the senators, played by John Goodman, Mark Consuelos, Clark Johnson, and Matt Malloy ""live like frat brothers."" It was inspired by a real Capitol Hill property in which Democratic senators have lived over the years, and it's been kicking around in Trudeau's brain since 2008. Notes the director of Amazon Studios, ""When it comes to Washington and its foibles and what makes it unique, few people have been more insightful and more knowledgeable than Garry Trudeau."""

As Kyodo News reports, the princess' family is worried about a money issue swirling around the family of her potential future husband, Kei Komuro. It seems that Komuro's mother used money from a former romantic partner to pay for her son's educational expenses. Now there's apparently a rift between the two former lovers about repayment, and Mako's parents, Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, want it publicly cleared up before any nuptials take place, according to Japanese media reports. This isn't the first sign of trouble for the impending nuptials. The couple initially announced plans to marry in November 2017, but abruptly postponed the wedding until 2020 and explained that they were rushing things. And when New York's Fordham University announced that the princess' ""fiance"" would be attending law school there, the Japanese royal family chafed at the term ""fiance"" as the couple's engagement ceremony has not taken place, prompting the school to issue a new release without it. Assuming Princess Mako goes through with the wedding, she will have to renounce her royal status, though the Guardian notes that the couple would get nearly $1 million from the government to help with that transition. (All this is unfolding as the princess' grandfather, Emperor Akhito, prepares to abdicate next year.)"

conspiring to have the man beaten in jail. A lawsuit submitted by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs. The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye knew about Ford's alcohol and drug use and claims he was threatened with ""dire consequences"" if he did not remain quiet. ""They wanted to know if I was going to do the right thing—was I going to keep my mouth shut,"" MacIntyre tells the Globe and Mail. He got attacked in a jailhouse shower and ended up with a broken leg and shattered teeth. Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said today that the allegations are ""without fact or foundation."" Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit. ""Remind me again, how the hell is Rob Ford still in office?"" asks Jordan Yerman at the Vancouver Observer."

contempt neonazis how one mans pause became haunting symbol aleppos destruction terrorists building drones france destroying eagles,"– When Peter Butera got up to begin his valedictorian speech at his high school graduation ceremony in Exeter, Pa., on Friday, he probably never dreamed he'd be finishing it on Jimmy Kimmel Live! four days later. But on Tuesday night the 18-year-old class president appeared via Skype on the late-night talk show to recite the tail end of a speech that had been cut off by Wyoming Area Secondary Center administrators the week before. CBS Philly reports that administrators shut off Butera's microphone after he veered off his pre-approved script to condemn what he called the ""authoritative attitude"" of some of the school's faculty and staff, an attitude, he said, that ""prevents students from developing as true leaders. Hopefully, this will change."" At which point his mic went silent. The Wilkes-Barre Citizens' Voice quotes a statement from principal Jon Pollard in which he explains he felt obligated to stop Butera's speech in order to ""ensure the remainder of [it] was not demeaning or derogatory to his classmates, the underclassmen, faculty, staff or administration."" The Washington Post talks to a friend of Butera's who says Butera was frustrated by having numerous ideas turned down by Pollard during his four years as class president. (Other off-script lines from Butera: ""At our school, the title of class president can more accurately be class party planner. Student council’s main obligation is to paint signs every week."") The Villanova-bound Butera doesn’t think his speech could have gone any better: ""I got my point across and them cutting the microphone proved my point to be true."" (Valedictorians have had issues before.)"

The new displays will be 4.6-inch ""retina"" displays, and the updated phone will launch sometime around the second quarter this year, the paper said. While Apple started the trend of smartphones with large touchscreens, its 3.5-inch screen has started to look diminutive next to offerings like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus' 4.65 inches. But MacRumors is dubious about the report, noting that numerous previous whispers put the new screen at 4 inches, and that many companies making iPhone cases seem to be betting on that. One source with a good track record said the new iPhone would have a longer, 4-inch display and an aluminum casing, but was ""still in the engineering phase, not early production."" Apple Insider is also dubious of the second quarter launch date; previous reports have always put it in September or October."

Police in Houston say two of the suspects managed to flee the warehouse. One of them was shot dead after opening fire on SWAT officers who emerged from a staging area and identified themselves, KTRK reports. The other man fled in a vehicle then hid in a quarry at the Houston Ship Channel when the vehicle crashed after a short chase, Houston Chronicle reports. Police say he died of a heart attack in custody after being found and bitten by a K-9. The other seven suspects, who were targeted by a months-long police and DEA operation, were arrested without incident and will be charged with federal crimes, police say."

Steenkamp's mother says the 29-year-old South African model ""was scared to take the relationship to the next level"" with Oscar Pistorius, so she never slept with the man who eventually killed her, the Sunday Times reports via the New York Daily News and the BBC. In the memoir Reeva: a Mother's Story, June Steenkamp says Pistorius and Steenkamp were together for several nights but never went all the way. ""She had confided to me that she hadn't slept with him,"" says June, whose book is being serialized by the Times and is out Nov. 6. ""There's no doubt in our minds that she decided to leave Oscar that night,"" says June. She adds that ""something went went horribly wrong, something upset her so terribly that she hid behind a locked door with two mobile phones,"" the Independent reports. According to June, a jealous, ""trigger-happy"" Pistorius shot her daughter and fired three more bullets so she ""couldn’t tell the world what really happened."" June goes on to describe the athlete as ""pathetic,"" ""moody,"" ""shifty,"" and ""arrogant."""

skills,"– Sgt. Pepper better have good insurance because—if its name is accurate—his Lonely Hearts Club Band has a dramatically increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. According to a study published Monday in Heart, people who feel lonely or are socially isolated have a 29% increase in risk of coronary heart disease and a 32% increase in risk of stroke. While previous studies have shown a person's general health is influenced by their social relationships, this may be the first to show ""deficiencies in social relationships"" are no good for your heart. Medical Daily reports researchers looked at 23 studies—a total of 181,000 people—about loneliness, social isolation, and health to come to their conclusion. The Guardian notes that coronary heart disease and strokes are the two leading causes of death in first-world countries. And the new study shows loneliness and social isolation are bigger risk factors for those problems than either work stress or general anxiety. “People have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,” the New York Times quotes study co-author Nicole Valtorta as saying. “Our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place.” The research is especially important as other studies show social isolation growing and young people feeling more lonely than ever before.

detail ways hiv may may spread organ transplantation,"– Doctors in South Africa had a wrenching dilemma: A baby in desperate need of a liver had been on the organ-donor waiting list for 181 days and wouldn't live much longer. The child's mother pleaded with doctors to take a portion of her own liver for a transplant, but one big issue stood in the way: The mother has HIV. Finally, surgeons at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre decided they had no choice and performed what is believed to be the world's first transplant from an HIV-positive donor, per a university release. The surgery itself went well, and, more significantly, the child is HIV negative one year later. It's too early to say whether that will hold true permanently, but the news is being hailed as a potentially big development, especially in countries such as South Africa where HIV is prevalent. ""This operation could be a game changer for South Africa,"" write three officials from the University of Witwatersrand (affiliated with the hospital) in the Conversation. ""The country has a large pool of virally suppressed HIV-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation."" The piece details the ethical quandaries the hospital faced, including whether it would be right to deny the mother a chance to save her baby, even with the risk of HIV infection. The story is drawing international attention, and in the US, Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health says doctors made the right choice—even if the child had emerged with HIV. ""If it is a choice between death and living reasonably well with a treatable infection, I think they made a quite reasonable choice,"" he tells the AP. (A canceled HIV test resulted in a huge payout for one patient.)"

reached a deal to go private, the company has announced. Shareholders will receive some $13.65 per share in a $24 billion deal, the New York Times reports, which marks a 25% premium over Dell's January share price. The privatization deal with Microsoft and private equity company Silver Lake Partners is the biggest since the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal notes. Once the biggest PC maker on the planet, the struggling Dell is now third; the move comes as founder and CEO Michael Dell hopes to retool his company. The deal incorporates Michael Dell's own 16% stake, some $700 million from his investment company, $1 billion from Silver Lake, and a $2 billion Microsoft investment. In return, Dell will likely work more closely with Windows, as was previously rumored. Meanwhile, four banks are backing the deal with $15 billion in evenly-divided debt. For Michael Dell, the company's floundering image is central to the overhaul, the Journal adds: ""It's pretty simple: His name is on the door,"" says a former exec."

Engineers discovered the cracks during a day-long inspection of the interior of the monument, AP reports. A 4-inch crack was discovered during an inspection of the exterior by helicopter soon after the quake, which also damaged the National Cathedral. The 555 foot-tall monument—the world's tallest stone structure—will remain closed to visitors indefinitely while engineers figure out how badly it has been damaged. Visitors at the site yesterday said they were relieved the monument survived the quake. ""People may say the monument is broken like our political system,” one visitor tells the New York Times. “But the fact is, it’s still standing and so are we."""

seen his share of hard times. The 44-year-old father of five lives with his wife and kids in Passaic, one of the poorest areas of North Jersey; years ago, a fire destroyed much of their store, and just one year later, thieves stole everything they could from the family's apartment. But now, finally, Quezada's luck has changed: On Saturday, as he did every night, he bought a Powerball ticket from Eagle Liquors—but this time, his was the winning ticket. He returned to Eagle Liquors last night to reveal himself to his excited neighbors as the winner of the $338 million jackpot. With the lump sum payment, he'll take home about $152 million after taxes, the Record reports. He also broke the news to his family: He called them only after signing the ticket, telling his wife, ""I'm a millionaire, Ines. Did you hear?"" Neighbors described the couple as quiet but hard-working, and expressed happiness at their good fortune. ""I'm just glad it went to somebody that could use it,"" says one. Another calls the win ""a blessing for the neighborhood,"" because ""it gives people hope that there is a blessing somewhere, for somebody."" As for what Quezada will do with the money, he says, ""I want to help a lot of people, in whatever they need, in rent, in whatever."" First, he'll help his family, the AP reports. In Spanish, he told reporters that he's ""very happy."""

Bob McDonnell and Jonnie R. Williams Sr., CEO of Star Scientific, continues, with a new $130,000 reveal. Williams gave $70,000 to a McDonnell-owned corporation last year, another $50,000 to McDonnell's wife, Maureen, in 2011, and $10,000 to McDonnell's daughter in December, sources tell the Washington Post. The governor didn't disclose any of those amounts. Previously revealed gifts included another ""wedding gift"" for McDonnell's daughter and a $6,500 Rolex, among other things. More unpleasantness for the McDonnell family: Sean McDonnell, the governor's 21-year-old son, was busted early Saturday on a public drunkenness charge, the Daily Progress reports. Police found him intoxicated in Charlottesville, where he attends the University of Virginia. And, facing pressure over the misuse of Executive Mansion resources for his family, McDonnell recently paid the state $2,400 to reimburse it for food and household supplies his kids used, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Specifically, McDonnell has been accused of sending things like paper towels and laundry detergent back to college with his children."

but a new study suggests they've got some protective power to boast of as well. Scientists think that bugs and plants have survived Antarctica's ice ages only because they found warmth near live volcanoes, reports AFP. They did so either in underground caves formed in the ice or by camping out on ground warmed by geothermal heat, explains LiveScience. ""Volcanic steam can melt large ice caves under the glaciers, and it can be tens of degrees warmer in there than outside,"" says a lead researcher from the Australian National University. ""Caves and warm steam fields would have been great places for species to hang out during ice ages."" The finding—based in part on the discovery that more mosses, lichens, and small bugs are found near volcanoes today—helps answer a question that has vexed Antarctic researchers: How did species that have been in the region for millions of years manage to survive those ice ages? Now it seems they waited them out in relative warmth before expanding their range again. The researchers say their discovery likely holds true outside Antarctica as well, notes Nature World News.

in the joke department. It set off a scare at the US Capitol this morning with a fake tweet reading, “BREAKING: Witnesses reporting screams and gunfire heard inside Capitol building,"" reports the Washington Post. A few others in a similar vein followed, and it turns out the site was promoting this satirical story, headlined ""Congress Takes Group of Schoolchildren Hostage."" Capitol Police weren't laughing, issuing a statement that all was well at the building and adding that the fake reports were under investigation. Reaction on the Internet has been mostly negative. (""I mean, I know you guys do satire, but I really don't get this one..."" went one typical Twitter post. ""The Onion botched a joke,"" says Gawker in its writeup.) The Onion's New York office wasn't apologetic: ""This is satire. That’s how it works.” The tweets came a day after this guy got arrested and charged with plotting to blow up the Capitol."

But most of the blog post is taken up with an explanation of why she got them in the first place: She had ""perfect A cup"" boobs, and she was happy with them. They grew to C cups during her first pregnancy, but after she stopped breastfeeding, when they deflated to their original size, they did not return to ""their original place,"" she writes. ""They were lower....much, much lower."" Her then-husband once referred to her breasts as looking like ""socks full of marbles with knots at the top,"" and though they ended up getting divorced, she remained insecure about her breasts and decided to get them augmented. She got saline implants, and during her second pregnancy, the cycle repeated itself. This time, while her boobs drooped a little post-breastfeeding, they remained ""perky-ish"" thanks to the implants. But after 12 years, they needed to be replaced, so she got a breast lift and silicone implants. That was when she realized she would need to keep replacing them: ""It was possible that at 80 years old I might have to get new implants!"" She was also worried about the silicone and ultimately decided it was time to get the implants removed. ""The bottom line...or top line.. is that; A. I am concerned for my health and 2. I don't like the way they look or feel. Frankly, I'd like to be able to take a Zumba class without the fear that I'll end up with two black eyes.""

Finally, officers skillfully plucked the gun right out of Brock Ray Bunge's hideout—without putting their lives in danger. ""The robot was a game changer,"" Capt. Jack Ewell tells the Los Angeles Times of the department's $300,000 Andros robot that did the deed; it's typically used to defuse bombs but is becoming increasingly useful in other cases. Officers say they were using the device to learn more about Bunge's position when they noticed Bunge was lying on his stomach with his weapon at his feet. While officers distracted Bunge, the robot grabbed the gun ""without him noticing,"" says Ewell. The robot then went back to remove the fencing, and Bunge surrendered as soon as he realized his gun was missing, police add; he has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted murder and robbery. Though the robot that nicked the gun is expensive, ""when it saves lives, it is more than worth it,"" Ewell says. Officers also used a robot during the Dallas shooting. Dutch police believe robots can even replace drug-sniffing dogs, reports the NL Times."

Maybe. Parisian city councilors have given the green light to a plan that would see the creation of a clothing-free zone somewhere within the city limits, the BBC reports. The location of the nudist area has yet to be determined, but Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard—a supporter—said the intention is to prevent any disruption of ""public order"" and suggested two wooded areas, the westside Bois de Boulogne or eastside Bois de Vincennes. France is famous for its nude beaches, and proponents—including the mayor—say that nudists should have a place within the capital city. For a country that's said to have 2 million nudists, the capital has been a mostly unwelcoming place. Currently, nudism in Paris is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $16,800, reports France24. It notes a single swimming pool in the city allows naked swimming, but even then, only after 9pm on certain days of the week. Opponents worry about inflaming tensions between conservative and liberal groups, particularly on the heels of the burkini brouhaha. Despite those objections, the BBC suggests the zone could be in place as early as next summer."

But while some say the overall package is lacking, others are glowing. Compared to Kathryn Stockett’s novel of the same name, the film is “impactful in parts, but noticeably lacking in Stockett's instinctive nuance,” writes Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News. “Taylor’s characters are familiar because we've seen them in movies so many times before: heroes and villains drawn in broad strokes, residents of a world regrettably lacking shades of gray.” In the New York Times, Manohla Dargis offers a similarly mixed reaction to the “big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum.” But “Viola Davis invests this cautious, at times bizarrely buoyant, movie with the gravity it frequently seems to want to shrug off.” Buoyancy isn’t a problem for Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times: “Laughter, which is ladled on thick as gravy, proves to be the secret ingredient—turning what should be a feel-bad movie about those troubled times into a heart-warming surprise.” And in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers notes that “a deeply touching human story filled with humor and heartbreak is rare in any movie season, especially summer.”"

injured Tuesday was likely organized by a one-armed Chechen terrorist who goes by ""Akhmed One-Arm,"" Fox News reports. A news organization in Turkey identified Ahmed Chatayev as the organizer of the terrorist attack, as did US officials, according to CNN. The news has yet to be confirmed by officials in Turkey. A report released in October said Chatayev was part of a ""group of militants that was planning attacks against US and Turkish facilities.” He is or was a top ISIS soldier, and the UN says he has 130 militants directly under his command. ""He's ... probably the No. 1 enemy in the Northern Caucasus region of Russia,"" US Rep. Michael McCaul tells CNN. Heavy has a list of five things to know about Chatayev, including that he claims he lost his arm while being tortured in a Russian prison but may have actually lost it in combat. He spent time as a political prisoner in Georgia and has been arrested in Sweden and the Ukraine in the past decade or so. Amnesty International helped prevent Chatayev from being extradited to Russia, where he was wanted, claiming he would be tortured there. Only two of the three suicide bombers that killed 44 people and wounded more than 200 at Ataturk Airport have been identified, but US officials don't believe Chatayev was the third. The bombers have been linked to Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. And while ISIS hasn't claimed responsibility, officials believe the terrorist organization is behind the attack."

future generations this story updated reflect filing paperwork fourth superpac,"– If other GOP contenders shrugged off Ted Cruz's chances of winning the nomination, it's a safe bet they're reassessing things after four new super PACS announced they'd raised a staggering $31 million to support his new candidacy. ""Even in the context of a presidential campaign cycle in which the major party nominees are expected to raise more than $1.5 billion, Cruz’s haul is eye-popping, one that instantly raises the stakes in the Republican fundraising contest,"" writes Mark Halperin at Bloomberg. The super PACs in question are only a week old, and it's unprecedented to have raised so much so quickly. So who's behind the money? The New York Times identifies the main player as a ""reclusive Long Islander"" named Robert Mercer. Mercer began his career at IBM but now runs a hedge fund called Renaissance Technologies, and like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson, he is taking advantage of the Citizens United case that loosened restrictions on wealthy donors. He's ""a very low-profile guy, but he’s becoming a bigger and bigger player,” says one campaign finance expert. And his backing of Cruz “sends the message to other donors that Cruz is a serious guy,” which in turn encourages other donors. The Times notes that Mercer's hedge fund is under investigation by the IRS, an agency that Cruz would love to abolish. A previous profile of Mercer at Bloomberg describes him as ""one of the most powerful men in Republican politics that nobody is talking about."""

Dr. Michelle Herren reportedly posted a photo that showed the first lady screaming with the comment, ""Doesn't seem to be speaking too eloquently here, thank god we can't hear her! Harvard??? That's a place for 'entitled' folks said all the liberals!"" She then added: ""Monkey face and poor ebonic English!!! There! I feel better and am still not racist!!! Just calling it like it is!"" Also calling it like it is: Joann Nieto, who informed the university of the comments after she saw the post stayed up for four days. A school spokesman said Thursday ""we are beginning the process to terminate Dr. Herren's faculty appointment"" (a nonpaid position), adding she has ""compromised her ability"" to teach and care for patients. It's not yet clear what the fate of her $363,00-a-year job at Denver Health Medical Center will be, though it confirms to Denver 7 she won't be seeing patients ""until further notice."" A rep adds, ""We are bumping up against a First Amendment right,"" with the Post noting it's difficult to fire public-sector employees who make offensive remarks when they're not at work. Herren tells Denver 7 her remarks were taken ""out of context"" and were in response to another comment that argued people can criticize Melania Trump freely but the same isn't true for Obama. She added she had no idea ""monkey face"" might be considered offensive."

michael capriglione told nbc10 lawsuit frivolous waste taxpayer time money,"– Nigel Sykes' attempted robbery of a Delaware pizzeria failed miserably—but he'd still like to get some cash out of the whole to-do. Armed with a gun, Sykes, 23, busted into the back door of Newport's Seasons Pizza in 2010 but eventually got tackled by employees. In a federal civil complaint, filed without an attorney, Sykes admits, ""I committed a robbery at Seasons Pizza"" but now alleges that the workers ""unnecessary"" roughed him up during that robbery, the News Journal reports. He wants $260,000 from the pizzeria, its employees, and Delaware State Police for his troubles. Though NBC Philadelphia reports similar complaints from Sykes have been thrown out in the past, a judge has so far allowed this latest suit—which Newport's police chief calls ""a joke""—to move forward. Sykes' self-written suit alleges the pizzeria's employees forced his gun from his hand, then ""participated in punching, kicking and pouring hot soup over my body"" while ""I was unarmed and defenseless."" Sykes, who's serving a 15-year sentence for robbery and attempted robbery, also argues he was knocked unconscious and awoke to two police officers using stun guns on him."

Francisco street yesterday found what a spokeswoman calls ""an extremely gruesome crime scene."" Next to a pile of garbage and debris, a rolling suitcase held dismembered human body parts, police say, per the San Francisco Chronicle. In case that isn't horrific enough, the police rep tells USA Today the body was so mutilated, a medical examiner was needed to determine if it belonged to a human or animal. A search turned up more body parts at three locations within a three-block radius, the Los Angeles Times reports, though it isn't clear if they belong to the victim in the suitcase, whose race, gender, and identity is unknown. ""There was one crime scene—it was just very large,"" the rep says, adding authorities have a ""preliminary, distinct suspect description"" and are ""actively attempting to locate this particular person of interest."" The same rep tells CNN, ""We do have people of interest that homicide investigators are speaking to."" Police are also attempting to nab surveillance footage from nearby businesses. Officers first arrived to the scene in the South of Market area around 4:15pm yesterday, but it isn't clear when the suitcase was left. USA Today describes the spot as a ""long-troubled area"" known for its high population of homeless people. Twitter's headquarters sits just about a block away."

But Barr, who told Twitter followers not to defend her after ABC canceled her hit show and talent agency ICM Partners severed ties, has now taken to retweeting users coming to her defense, reports CNBC. ""You had no idea VJ had any black blood … U made a political joke that fell flat,"" reads one comment retweeted by Barr on Wednesday, referring to the subject of Barr's racist tweet, Valerie Jarrett. Another retweeted comment reads, ""I look like a monkey. Why? My DNA is 96% similar to a monkey's. It makes scientific sense,"" per the Washington Post. Other Barr tweets are also getting attention, including two targeting billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The 87-year-old, who was 13 when Nazis invaded his native Hungary, ""turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth"" and now aims to ""overthrow"" the US ""by buying/backing candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law & favor 'feelings,'"" Barr claimed Tuesday. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted the claims to his 2.8 million followers, despite the New York Times describing them as ""baseless."" Soros ""did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round people up. He did not confiscate anybody’s property,"" a rep says in a statement, calling the accusations insulting ""to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth."""

Joseph Saelee beat Jonas Neubauer in the Classic Tetris World Championship grand final Sunday night in Oregon; a definite stunner, per Kotaku, considering Neubauer, a 37-year-old taproom manager, has come out on top seven times in the eight years the tournament has been held. Saelee, on the other hand, just started playing after watching the 2016 championships, he tells the BBC. And yes, he plays the iconic video game on an original 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console. Saelee, it should be noted, is 13 years younger than the NES version of the block stacking game. You can watch nearly seven hours of gaming in our video gallery or just skip to the winning moment; if you're not convinced all those hours are worth it, take note of what Alex Walker writes at Kotaku: ""The Classic Tetris World Championships is one of the best gaming events to spectate all year. It's easy to understand, gets real intense, and the commentary adds a ton to the proceedings."" (To lose weight, play Tetris?)"

week ago said often took 10 15 seconds page load now its boom boom boom  comes soon click button,"– Many of HealthCare.gov's well chronicled problems have reportedly been fixed, but that doesn't mean it's ready for prime time, insurers say. The site's ability to send consumer data to insurance companies remains flawed, and ""until the enrollment process is working from end to end, many consumers will not be able to enroll in coverage,"" says insurance trade group head Karen Ignagni. People have been calling insurers thinking they've signed up for a plan, but insurers have been missing some information—or lack any record of the transaction, the New York Times reports. Although insurers ""don’t have the responsibility or the capability to fix the system, they’re reliant on it,"" says one consultant. ""Somehow people are getting lost in the process,"" says one exec. ""If they go to a doctor or a hospital and we have no record of them, that will be very upsetting to consumers."" Sometimes, it remains unclear how much coverage the government is paying for, and insurers are concerned about late payments from the government. Some insurers and states are pushing for a way to leapfrog the federal site, the Wall Street Journal reports. Connecticut, for instance, wants to rely on its own data for confirming enrollees' citizenship and other information."

The rapper unveiled both his new album—The Life of Pablo—and clothing line—Yeezus Season 3—during an event at Madison Square Gardens in New York City. The whole thing was livestreamed around the world. And, as with most things having to do with Kanye West, it was all the Internet was talking about. Here are five things you need to know about Kanye's day: It was huge. The Verge reports more than 20 million tried to watch the stream of the nearly two-hour event at one time. ""The early viewership numbers are insane…There aren't many other musicians who could pull this off."" Lamar Odom was there. It was the former NBA player's first public appearance since nearly dying following an overdose at a Nevada brothel in October, according to People. Odom continues to recover from his coma and sat with estranged wife Khloé Kardashian after entering with the rest of West's family. Kanye made a video game. The Verge reports it's called Only One and depicts his late mother ""traveling through the gates of heaven,"" apparently alternating between her own set of wings and a pegasus. West says a lot of people turned down his pitch for the game. Martin Shkreli tried to steal his thunder. The legally troubled ""pharma bro"" offered West $10 million for The Life of Pablo, hoping to delay or prevent its release to the public, according to the New York Times. ""Instead of releasing this product for your millions of fans, I ask you to sell this recording solely to me,"" Shkreli tweeted. ""I believe you (and your partners) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action."" Kanye is still super quotable. Cosmopolitan lists 16 of the lyrical highlights from The Life of Pablo, including ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that [expletive] famous"" and—inevitably—""I love you like Kanye loves Kanye."""

pictures photo shutterstock,"– While we all love our smartphones, laptops, and other tech gadgets, it's inaccurate to refer to them as ""sexy""—unless of course you plan to make love to them, says Gizmodo writer Mat Honan. The characterization has become so standard among tech reviewers, Honan believes it's time readers call out the cliche: ""The next time you see a professional writer refer to an inanimate object full of circuitry and cadmium as 'sexy,' please inquire as to whether said writer does in fact find it to be arousing."" It's lazy writing, and ""it means you don't give a damn about your audience."" Since ""sexy"" is a descriptor pretty much everyone old enough to buy a gadget can understand, writers don't hesitate to throw it around to easily get their point across. ""Maybe you actually do want to get it on with your iPhone. Maybe you really do find vaporware coffeemakers sexually stimulating. That's fine! No judgment from me,"" Honan writes. ""But make it clear. Let your readers know that you plan to make sweet, sweet love to that all-in-one printer."" (Click to see a few examples of ""sexy""-usage offenders, here, here, and here.)"

steven rea 2158545629 sreaphillynewscom follow twitter stevenrea read blog on movies online wwwinquirercomonmovies,"– Much like in real life, Matt Damon's character in the sci-fi thriller Elysium isn't too fond of government bureaucrats. Set in royally screwed-up Los Angeles (home to the masses) and an idyllic space station in the clouds (home to the rich) circa 2154, this flick from Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has both the compelling themes and action-packed fight scenes to make it a summer blockbuster. So is it one? Critics are split. The action sequences, complete with ""futuristic CGI flying machines"" are impressive, but it's ""Blomkamp's critique of a society riven by class and racial differences"" that sets it apart, Soren Anderson writes for the Seattle Times. ""Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here."" But at the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan's high hopes were dashed. ""Elysium is no promised land."" Though Matt Damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, ""the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped."" District 9 did a much better job of connecting genre (sci-fi) and theme (""socio-political concerns""). Even with the talented Damon along for the ride, Dana Stephens at Slate writes Elysium ""does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot ... Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights. It’s a waste of a perfectly good dystopia."" But over at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Steven Rea sees things differently. ""Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-hand-basket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake."" Sure, it can be a little generic at times—""haven't we just seen all this head-bashing, hanging-from-catwalks, mixed-martial-arts mayhem in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3?—but ""as summer movie sci-fi extravaganzas go, Elysium is easily the best thing out there right now."""

inspired to begin what the Dayton Daily News calls ""a kindness revolution."" He resolved for the entire year of 2012 to perform a random act of kindness every day. “I decided I wanted to do something that would inspire her in the future,"" said the new dad. ""I wanted to be a better person."" And so Ryan launched his year of altruism. Examples: “I tracked down my sixth-grade teacher, Mr. Plecas, and wrote him a letter thanking him for being my favorite teacher ever."" He also sent a condolence letter to a family who lost their son in the Afghanistan war. In one day, he complimented 25 strangers, and on another day he stood on the corner doling out free hugs. Yesterday, he took firefighters to lunch. You can keep track of his random feats at his blog, 366randomacts.org. (He's up to day 39)."

Well, it turns out the sound of an actual ticking clock can speed up your reproductive timing, making you want to have babies earlier, according to a new study published in Springer's journal Human Nature. Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes—things like when they'd like to marry and have kids and how much they'd be willing to alter their ""requirements"" for a mate in order to start a family earlier—and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women's answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time. ""The very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners—both central aspects of women’s mating-related psychology,"" says one of the lead researchers. Women who grew up in lower socioeconomic areas were particularly affected, wanting to get married and start families even earlier—and placing a lower priority on their mate's status and earning potential—than women who were raised with more resources. Not surprisingly, men, who can typically father children well into their later years, were not affected by the clock sound. As Jesse Singal notes in New York, ""all sorts of subtle cues can affect how people answer questions,"" but this result is still ""kinda weird.""

peskoe llp who cocounsel carlson the complaint seeks compensatory damages damages mental anguish punitive damages this story updated throughout,"– Gretchen Carlson made waves last month when she voiced approval for an assault weapons ban, but that was nothing compared to the bomb she dropped Wednesday: that she's no longer employed by Fox News and she's filing a sexual harassment and wrongful termination suit against her former boss, Roger Ailes, Politico reports. ""As you may have heard, I'm no longer with @FoxNews. I value your support and friendship so please stay in touch,"" the now-former host of The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson tweeted Wednesday, adding links to her social media pages and website. The news about her suit was emailed to reporters from the law firm representing her, noting her contract had been terminated June 23, even though Fox never announced it; Carlson's own tweets from last month suggested she was simply on vacation. The complaint alleges Ailes made ""sexually-charged comments [to Carlson], ranging from lewd innuendo, ogling and remarks about Ms. Carlson's body to demands for sex as a way for her to improve her job standing."" Those remarks reportedly included statements about Carlson's legs and behind, requests that she wear form-fitting outfits, and ""sexist comments."" She also claims she was fired in 2013 from her co-host chair on Fox & Friends and given less money for her own show after she complained about ""demeaning and discriminatory behavior on and off the set,"" specifically from co-host Steve Doocy, per an attorney statement. ""Opposing sexism and rejecting unwanted sexual come-ons should never cost a woman her job or subject her to disparagement and emotional anguish,"" another lawyer tells Politico. As for Carlson herself, she says in her own statement: ""I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career. Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace."" Read Ailes' response here."

Rodrigo Duterte continued his string of inflammatory, anti-US statements by telling President Obama to ""go to hell"" Tuesday, Reuters reports, after the US refused to sell him weapons to continue his violent crackdown on drug dealers. ""If you don't want to sell arms, I'll go to Russia,"" Duterte said. ""I sent the generals to Russia and Russia said 'do not worry, we have everything you need, we'll give it to you.' And as for China, they said 'just come over and sign and everything will be delivered.' "" Duterte previously called Obama a ""son of a bitch,"" and a State Department rep calls his latest stance ""at odds with the warm relationship"" the two countries have long enjoyed. Duterte's bloody campaign is averaging 38 deaths a day, Al-Jazeera reported in September, and his methods have drawn harsh criticism from the international community, including the US. Duterte on Tuesday expressed frustration at this slight, saying: ""Instead of helping us, the first to hit was the State Department. So you can go to hell, Mr. Obama, you can go to hell."" He then threatened to ""break up"" with the US, then added, for good measure: ""EU, better choose purgatory. Hell is full already. Why should I be afraid of you?"" (On Sunday, he was busily apologizing to the Jewish community for a jab about Adolf Hitler.)"

The White House had to make a strange about-face today and acknowledge that President Obama has, in fact, met his Uncle Omar. Not only that, but the younger Obama actually lived with his uncle for a few weeks in Cambridge in the 1980s, reports the Boston Globe. The tidbit surfaced this week during Onyango Obama's deportation hearing in Boston. Onyango—Omar is his nickname—testified that his nephew stayed with him for a brief spell when Barack arrived in town to attend Harvard Law School. “It’s a good thing to let your nephew stay with you,” he said afterward, explaining that ""your brother’s kids are your kids as well.” This wouldn't have caused headlines if not for the fact that a White House spokesman said in 2011—after Omar's arrest for drunken driving—that the two had never met. Jay Carney explained the mistake today by saying no staffers had actually asked the president in person, reports the LA Times. This time, they did. “The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in a decade,"" he added. But given that Omar was allowed to remain in the country, maybe that will change?"

Stanford was convicted in March of bilking investors in a $7 billion Ponzi scheme that spanned 20 years. Prosecutors sought 230 years, calling him a ""ruthless predator"" who orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in history. Stanford's lawyers hoped to get him out on time already served. Investors weren't having any of that: ""You, sir, are a dirty rotten scoundrel,"" said one of the victims allowed to address the court, notes Forbes."

tortoises supplement populations critical habitat areas said hoffman referring recipient areas,"– The mission: to airlift 1,156 desert tortoises to a place where there's no threat of being flattened by tanks. The Marines are this month moving the reptiles out of a corner of California's Mojave Desert where the Corps will soon begin extensive live-fire training, the Los Angeles Times reports. Packed up two per plastic bin, the hubcap-sized creatures are being loaded into helicopters and flown 25 miles away to federal lands beyond the Marines' Twentynine Palms base northeast of Palm Springs. Their new home is far enough away to keep tortoises from wandering back into the line of fire when the Marines begin ""longer and more involved"" training exercises this summer that the Press-Enterprise reports will better position them to carry out missions in ""global hot spots."" Operation Desert Tortoise doesn't come cheap: Its $50 million price tag covers everything from the 125 biologists USNI News describes as setting out to locate, examine, and box up the tortoises to an agreed-upon 30 years of monitoring. The Marines have been pushing for this move since 2008, an effort complicated by the tortoises' ""threatened"" status. Environmentalists threatened to sue, citing the harm that taking away 100 square miles of habitat might do, but the Times reports the program got final approval after the US Fish and Wildlife Service said it couldn't finish its review before the spring relocation window closed. A biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity expressed concerns there might not be adequate food in the new habitat. (This really old tortoise is the ""savior"" of the Galapagos.)"

The campaign to destroy Moammar Gadhafi's air defenses and establish a no-fly zone is almost complete, and American officials are seeking to hand over leadership of the operation to European allies, reports the New York Times. ""My sense is that unless something unusual or unexpected happens, we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks, "" said Gen. Carter Ham. Coalition forces aren't attempting to provide air cover for rebels, he added, warning of a potentially long stalemate between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels, AP reports. President Obama says that he expects control of the operation to be handed over within days. ""It is US policy that Gadhafi needs to go,” he told reporters. “And we’ve got a wide range of tools in addition to our military effort to support that policy."""

And now, DNA has positively identified Farrenkopf as the mummified body found in the backseat of her Jeep in March. “This has brought some closure for our family, knowing we may finally lay Pia to rest,” says a message posted to Facebook on July 15. However, officials still don’t know how Farrenkopf died, MLive.com reports—her badly decomposed body was missing the heart, liver, and lungs, which are usually used to determine cause of death, and mummified muscle didn’t yield any results in a toxicology test, the Oakland County Deputy Medical Examiner explains to the Detroit Free Press. “The possibility of hypothermia or any drug or chemical intoxication cannot be ruled out,” he says. Though the death was treated initially as a homicide, investigators have found no evidence that the Pontiac, Michigan, woman—who would have turned 50 this year—was murdered, the Times Herald adds. Her assumed time of death has been pinned down, however, by subpoenaing bank, health, and phone records, which indicate she died in early 2009. Reuters reports that investigators also found out Farrenkopf was seen alive in early 2009. She’d stopped working in 2008 and, following her death, her bills were paid automatically; the money ran out last year, eventually leading to her discovery."

necco wafers  companys candies  available generations come,"– CandyStore.com is calling it ""the Great NECCO Wafer Panic,"" and that's no exaggeration. Terrified by reports that the New England Confectionery Co. may soon be out of business, fans of the candy company's sugar wafers are stocking up, with one woman offering to exchange her 2003 Honda Accord for CandyStore.com's hefty stash. The offer was refused, so she bought 48 rolls instead, reports the Boston Globe. Jon Prince of CandyFavorites.com tells NPR that another fan tried to buy his entire stock of NECCO Wafers and cried after learning sales were being limited. ""They said they couldn't imagine a world without their NECCO wafers,"" says Prince. Of course, not everyone loves the wafers, which come in flavors like chocolate, clove, and licorice. ""I mean, it is really like chewing on chalk,"" one man tells NPR. More likely to be missed are NECCO's conversation hearts, always a hit around Valentine's Day. A few weeks after this year's holiday, NECCO said it would be forced to close—meaning 395 lost jobs at its factory in Revere, Mass.—unless it found a buyer by May. NECCO sales on CandyStore.com have jumped 82% in the aftermath, while wafer sales have spiked 150%. The turnaround might not be enough to save NECCO, but ""who knows, NECCO wafers might make a comeback the way Twinkies did,"" Revere's mayor tells the Wall Street Journal."

you were hoping that Charlie Sheen’s long overdue firing might get the tiger-blood-drinking star off your television set and computer screen for a while … no such luck. Sheen reacted to his ouster in plenty of predictably bizarre ways, which the Hollywood Reporter helpfully rounds up: He drank out of a bottle labeled “Tiger Blood” while waving around a machete on the roof of Live Nation. He released another episode of Sheen’s Korner, which involved him smoking a cigarette out of his nose. He texted People the following: There is “war to wage … The winds are howling tonight. The gods are hungry. The beast is alive. And awake. And deadly.” Meanwhile, TMZ snagged a copy of the letter Warner Brothers sent to Sheen’s lawyer justifying his firing, and New York actually read all 11 pages. Buried amidst the obvious (“Your client … appears to be very ill”), the magazine found some new details. Though Sheen claims he was always ready for work, the letter says he frequently “had difficulty remembering his lines and hitting his marks.” Perhaps even more damning, the letter claims there actually was—despite what Sheen has said—a morals clause in his contract, which he violated by “furnishing cocaine to others.” Click for photos of Sheen waving his machete."

copyright  2015 author reprinted permission st martins press llc,"– Fidel Castro, ragtag communist revolutionary? Not according to a new book that chronicles his alleged luxurious lifestyle and drug-smuggling into the United States. A former bodyguard to Castro, Juan Reinaldo Sanchez—who fled Cuba in 2008 and has made similar allegations before—describes them fully in The Double Life of Fidel Castro: My 17 Years as Personal Bodyguard to El Lider Maximo. In a juicy New York Post excerpt, Sanchez claims that he overheard Castro meeting with a loyal general, José Abrantes, about drug trafficking: ""What business!"" Sanchez writes, with co-writer Axel Gylden. ""Very simply, a huge drug-trafficking transaction was being carried out at the highest echelons of the state."" According to the book, Castro and Gen. Abrantes discussed smuggling cocaine into the US. Castro's reasoning: ""If the Yanks were stupid enough to use drugs that came from Colombia, not only was that not his problem ... it served his revolutionary objectives in the sense that it corrupted and destabilized American society,"" the book reads. Sanchez also accuses Castro of covering up his involvement by engineering sham trials that led to the deaths of two devoted officers, including Abrantes; this fueled the alcoholism of brother Raul, who feared he would be next. Imprisoned in Cuba for two years before fleeing, Sanchez has already accused Castro of secretly living a luxurious life that includes an 88-foot yacht and a Caribbean getaway island, the Miami Herald reported last year."

Miller is the latest celeb accused of sexual assault, but he and his wife have issued a joint statement strongly denying the allegations. The Daily Beast first reported the accusations, made by an anonymous woman who knew Miller from their days at George Washington University more than a decade ago. She claims Miller assaulted her in two separate incidents: In the first, she says he punched her in the mouth during consensual sex, fracturing a tooth. In the second, she says he forcefully choked her during sex and ""anally penetrated me without my consent."" On Instagram, Miller denies the claims, which were addressed by a student court at the time, though the school will not divulge the outcome. “We met this woman over a decade ago while studying together in college, she attempted to break us up back then by plotting for over a year before making contradictory claims and accusations,"" writes Miller with his wife, Kate. He adds that he's sure an investigation would clear him. Miller also accuses the woman of ""using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations."" Meanwhile, the Hollywood Reporter notes that Comedy Central announced Tuesday it was canceling Miller's animated series, The Gorburger Show, after one season. However, a network rep says the move is not related to the new controversy."

morning according police tribune reporters jeremy gorner carlos sadovi kim geiger deanese williamsharris adam sege contributed pnickeastribunecom dyjacksontribunecom mitsmithtribunecom jmdelgadotribunecom,"– The news out of Chicago just five days ago was encouraging: after a murder-riddled 2012, this year's murder rate had plummeted to a level not seen in 50 years. Today, the news is of a darker nature. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday, a total of 46 people were shot in the city, seven fatally, per the Tribune. (Other sources put the tally slightly lower.) The stat does represent a sort of improvement: The Tribune reports that around this time last year, those numbers were 53 and nine, respectively. And the Atlantic Wire notes that a deadlier weekend has already occurred in 2013: January closed with eight deaths. The youngest victim, 16-year-old Kevin Rivera, apparently tried to flee from a gunman on a bicycle late Saturday. The dead teen's family was just two weeks away from a move from their sometimes dangerous Hermosa neighborhood."

Reuters reports on the new evidence that brought them to that conclusion: a silver-colored pistol prosecutor Ricardo Jimenez says Sebastian Woodroffe purchased in early April. They were told by a witness that the pistol tumbled out of the 41-year-old's backpack when locals, angry over Olivia Arevalo's death, grabbed him; he was subsequently lynched. Jimenez says no weapon has been found, but ""he is the main suspect."" As for a motive, Jimenez says Arevalo's son owed Woodroffe nearly $4,500, though Jimenez told the BBC Arevalo's family claims Woodroffe became enraged when Arevalo wouldn't conduct an ayahuasca ceremony for him. Meanwhile, the AP reports Peru's attorney general has ordered two suspects be arrested in connection with Woodroffe's death. It adds forensic experts are examining the Canadian's remains to see if there is any evidence of his shooting Arevalo. (This ayahuasca ceremony ended in death in 2015.)"

The spot doesn't reference Neymar by name, but the Brazilian superstar has been known to do some theatrical rolls of his own—see here. Sports Illustrated and USA Today think KFC is clearly mocking Neymar, though EWN suggests the ad came out at the start of the tournament, prompting it to ask, ""Did KFC Predict Neymar Flopping""?"

confident present processes knowing continually improve time build capacity with files bryan mullan janet silver,"– Canadian lawmakers have taken the final step toward legalizing recreational marijuana—and it will become official as soon as Queen Elizabeth II's representative signs off on it. A bill ending the country's 95-year prohibition on cannabis passed Canada's Senate by a vote of 52 to 29, CTV reports. After royal assent is granted—which could happen as soon as Wednesday—the government will set a date for the new law, Bill C-45, to come into force. The bill grants provinces a ""buffer period"" of eight to 12 weeks to prepare for legal marijuana sales, meaning Canadians over 18 could be able to buy legal pot as soon as September, the CBC reports. Canadians will also be allowed to grow small amounts of pot for recreational use. Independent Sen. Tony Dean, the bill's Senate sponsor, said he was feeling ""great,"" Global News reports. ""We've just witnessed a historic vote for Canada. The end of 90 years of prohibition,"" he said. He added that it is now time to start addressing the harms of cannabis and the $7 billion illegal market, an approach echoed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""It’s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits,"" he tweeted. ""Today, we change that."" The bill makes Canada only the second country, after Uruguay, to legalize recreational use of cannabis nationwide, reports the BBC. (Canadian pot growers started ramping up production last year.)"

The explosions at the nuclear test site deep in the mountains of the North's sparsely populated northeast were centered on three tunnels into the underground site and a number of observation towers in the surrounding area, reports the AP. The planned closing was previously announced by Kim Jong Un ahead of his planned summit with President Trump next month. Sky News correspondent Tom Cheshire was on hand, and described it thusly: ""We hiked up into the mountains and watched the detonation from about 500 meters away. ... There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud."" The North's decision to close the Punggye-ri nuclear test site has generally been seen as a welcome gesture by Kim to set a positive tone ahead of the summit. Even so, it is not an irreversible move and would need to be followed by many more significant measures to meet Trump's demands for real denuclearization. By bringing in the foreign media, mainly television networks, the North is apparently hoping to have images of the closing—including explosions to collapse tunnel entrances—broadcast around the world. The group included an AP television crew. The North did not invite international inspectors to the ceremony, which limits its value as a serious concession.

effect thursday a federal judge hawaii also scheduled hearing wednesday revised ban in maryland groups arguing revised ban legal flaws trumps first executive order,"– A federal judge in Hawaii blocked President Trump's revised travel ban just hours before it was set to go into effect across the country, the Washington Post reports. Hawaii had filed a lawsuit over the new executive order, which halted visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority nations for 90 days and stopped new refugees for 120 days, claiming it hurts tourism, business, and universities and would keep people from those six countries from visiting family in Hawaii. The state alleged the order, which also cuts the number of refugees allowed in the US next year in half, was essentially a Muslim ban. US District Judge Derrick Watson froze the order Wednesday, saying Hawaii has a ""strong likelihood of success on their claim,"" according to Politico. More than six states are currently trying to halt the new travel ban, the AP reports. Arguments against it were also scheduled to be heard in Maryland and Washington state on Wednesday. Trump issued the revised travel ban after his first attempt was blocked by a federal judge in Washington state. Justice Department lawyers defending the new executive order said the ban was well within the president's power and claimed its potential harms were only speculation."

stuck summer holidays august naturally becomes prime time year say goodbye images fotolia giphy 7,"– They didn't set out to do a study on divorce, but two University of Washington researchers poring over a range of sociological data saw such a clear pattern emerge that they've ended up with one: It turns out that that married couples divorce most often in March and August. When the researchers plotted the data from 2001 to 2015, the divorce spike in those two months was both striking and consistent, they write in a press release. And while that data comes exclusively from Washington state, it seems to apply nationwide. The researchers followed up with a look at data from Ohio, Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, and found the same pattern. So what's going on? They think winter holidays and summer vacations are a big factor. These are both ""culturally sacred times for families,"" says associate sociology professor Julie Brines, per the UW release. That is, couples may be reluctant to split around Christmas, or just ahead of an annual vacation, and instead view those times instead as an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship. ""One last shot,"" as Brines puts it, per the Atlantic. If they fail, the added stress of the holidays or the tight quarters of a vacation then push the couple toward divorce. The delay from post-holidays to March in the divorce filings may be because the holidays put such a heavy dent in the wallet, notes Bustle. That's less of an issue in the summer, and the researchers speculate that, for couples with kids, the start of school may actually speed things along.

content quality performance reproducible easily quantitatively tracked modern conditioning techniques,"– Human radiologists, look out. Pigeons turn out to be expert mammogram readers after very little training, at least according to a study published this week in PLoS ONE. Using 16 pigeons in a chamber with a touchscreen, scientists trained them to peck at one of two colored buttons to correspond with the type of image they were being shown; if they got it right, they got food. It turns out that those beady little eyes picked up patterns showing malignant versus benign breast tissue very well and very fast. At first, as they were trained for what to spot, they were right 50% of the time. ""In some sense, the pigeon and the person are starting at the same place,"" says one researcher, experimental psychologist Edward Wasserman. ""They're equally naive."" But a mere two weeks into the experiment the pigeons were identifying the images correctly 85% of the time, reports the Washington Post. What's more, the birds were able to take what they'd learned from the first, familiar set of slides and apply it to new images they'd never seen before, boasting a success rate that was just a few percentage points lower. And they performed even better as a flock than individually—with a success rate maxing out at 99% when required to ""vote"" as a group, reports Gizmodo. It's more likely that robots, not pigeons, will be the ones to take the place of humans someday. But Wasserman hopes pigeons will be taken more seriously and studied more closely. ""The pigeon has kind of a bum rap,"" he says. ""Humans are not the only intelligent animals walking and swimming and flying on Earth."" It's also helpful, he tells Discover, that they're ""workaholics."" (Pigeons have a biological GPS.)"

salon workers has caught the attention of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced he's putting emergency measures into place to go after wage theft and health hazards in the industry, the AP reports. In a statement cited by the Times, Cuomo said he's setting up a task force, effective immediately, to check salons individually, come up with mandates to protect workers from possibly dangerous chemicals wafting around their salons, and conduct a six-language educational campaign to let workers know this kind of debasement isn't OK. ""We will not stand idly by as workers are deprived of their hard-earned wages and robbed of their most basic rights,"" Cuomo said in the statement. Several government agencies, including the Health Department, were spurred into action last week after the two-part Times article ran. Rules going into effect ASAP include publicly posted signage (in different languages) in salons listing workers' rights, a requirement that manicurists wear gloves and masks, and a mandate that all salons are bonded so employees can recoup wages if it's found they've been denied rightful earnings, per the Times. Cuomo's office says the task force agencies won't probe workers' immigration status. Creating the emergency plan allowed Cuomo to skirt red tape. ""The article highlighted a significant problem in New York State,"" the governor's general counsel tells the Times. “We cannot wait to address the problem."" (What could help protect workers: more ""green"" salons.)"

man banned from Alaska Airlines for touching a flight attendant says he's a victim of discrimination against men. Mike Timon, angry over his treatment by the airline, tells the San Diego Union-Tribune that he was banned for touching the female flight attendant on the buttocks as he sat in first class on a flight from Oregon to San Diego on Dec. 26. Timon says he touched the woman politely on her back to get her attention so he could order a drink. Timon, who owns a medical equipment company and frequently flies first class, said that when no drink came, he pressed his call button, and a male flight attendant came to say he had been cut off. Timon said he had only had a single drink and was sober. He says his gesture was misunderstood as sexual harassment, and he was met by police who escorted him off the plane. Police took statements from Timon and others but there was no further action. ""For me to be accused of this, and for me to be escorted off the plane by police? This is it. I'm blowing up,"" Timon says. ""It's unnecessary. It's discrimination toward me."" He says widespread concern over sexual harassment has hurt men like him. ""It's out of control and I am pissed,"" he says. Alaska spokeswoman Ann Johnson confirmed that Timon cannot fly on the airline pending the outcome of an investigation but said she could not provide specifics about his case, the AP reports. ""Alaska Airlines will not tolerate any type of sexual misconduct that creates an unsafe environment for our guests and crew members and we are fully committed to do our part to address this serious issue,"" Johnson said."

options feel compelled put children risk until then tobacco keeps growing it demand farm workers ages,"– Children are toiling in unsafe conditions, suffering everything from breathing problems to vomiting, and putting in 12-hour days and 72-hour weeks. Think we're talking a third-world sweatshop? It's what's happening right now on US tobacco farms, Human Rights Watch alleges in a report today. The group spoke to 141 tobacco farm workers aged 7 to 17, and found that many came in bare-skin contact with tobacco plants. That can cause acute nicotine poisoning—and indeed, 66% of those polled reported symptoms consistent with that, including dizziness, nausea, and headaches. ""On the first day when I was working [chemicals] got on my face a lot and I didn't know until I got home later that my face was burning,"" one 13-year-old worker tells the BBC. US labor laws protecting child laborers have exceptions for agricultural jobs, the group explains, allowing children of any age to work the fields, and those 12 and older to work unlimited hours. An attempt to change that for tobacco farms died in 2012. HRW shared its findings with tobacco producers, and most expressed concern. Philip Morris, which has the toughest child labor policy, tells Reuters that it believes there's an opportunity to impose an industry-wide standard. The complete report is here."

It will also keep up its current practice of spending $40 billion a month on mortgage bonds, the AP reports, bringing its total monthly spending to $85 billion, and growing its now almost $3 trillion portfolio. This is a ""historic move"" that ""will change how we think about Fed policy, yet again,"" writes Sudeep Reddy at the Wall Street Journal. Instead of pegging its targets to specific time frames, the Fed is now tying its policies to specific economic outcomes. The policy is sometimes referred to as the ""Evans rule,"" because Chicago Fed President Charles Evans has been pushing for it for months. The Fed is also sending a strong, loud signal that it's willing to allow inflation to rise if that's what it takes to reduce unemployment."

sherman eunice lee ryan hutchins contributed report,"– Rutgers University is scrambling to deal with reports that its newly minted athletic director and supposed scandal slayer Julie Hermann has a spotty past of her own—complete with abuse allegations and a sex-discrimination settlement—and emerging emails show bickering and complaints among the very board of trustees that appointed Hermann in the first place. Trustees say they were given the names of two finalists the day before the first was to be interviewed, and they spent only 75 minutes interviewing Hermann, reports the Star-Ledger. ""It was not enough time,"" says one. ""Let’s not present this as any kind of exemplary process. Subsequent events have proven otherwise.” The search leaders tried via email to smooth things over, telling trustees, ""You all had the opportunity to examine Julie’s credentials, to spend some time with her when she was on campus. As you know, there was strong support for Julie."" That prompted a string of emails that the lone student on the search committee likened to ""a professional catfight in my email inbox."" Adding insult to injury, Rutgers paid an executive search company $70,000 to vet finalists for the job, notes the New York Times; now, the school is also paying a crisis-management company $150,000 to deal with the scandals' fallout."

study required investigate impacts phenomenon may evolution social structure population behaviour individuals within it,"– Scientists have observed a behavior never before seen in killer whales, and it makes for a grim discovery. Following strange calls from orcas off the northeastern coast of British Columbia's Vancouver Island in December, researchers observed the first known case of infanticide among the whales. After tracking down the orcas and hearing a ruckus in the water, the scientists spotted a male orca with a newborn calf in its mouth, being chased by the calf's mother and other members of its family. As the male's mother attempted to intervene, the calf's mother ""hit the male so hard that ... his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air,"" ecologist Jared Towers tells the CBC. ""We were really quite horrified and fascinated."" The male still didn't let go of the calf, which had died by that point, according to Newsweek. Researchers, describing the case in Scientific Reports, say the male orca likely killed the calf so the male orca could mate with the infant's mother. In other mammals, infanticide ""forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker,"" Towers says. He adds researchers previously thought female orcas were picky about mates, but this behavior suggests ""females don't have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding."" The CBC notes $9 million the Canadian government has dedicated to orca research may reveal more about the endangered species in time, as Washington state works on protection, per Time. (Orca pregnancies are failing.)"

developer mike sullivan,"– It was the article that launched a thousand, well, articles: an extensive New York Daily News piece on Richard Simmons published Saturday that claimed the ""intensely social public figure"" has for the last two years essentially vanished, having stopped responding to calls and emails, and suggested an overly controlling live-in housekeeper, Teresa Reveles, is to blame. The fitness guru's rep, Tom Estey, called the claims ""untrue and preposterous"" in a statement to People, saying Simmons just wanted a break ""after 40 years of being in the spotlight."" To USA Today, Estey said, ""I don’t want the readers ... to think this man is a Howard Hughes recluse in his own home."" But, still, no word from Simmons himself ... until Sunday night. In a phone conversation with ET, Simmons said quite plainly, ""I am not kidnapped. I am just in my house right now. This is how I want to live my life right now. And to all the people that are worried about me, please don't be. If I was in any trouble, if I was hurting in any way, I would reach out. It is time right now for Richard Simmons to take care of Richard Simmons."" He too cites his 40 years of being in the public eye, and references a ""very difficult"" knee replacement surgery. But he says, ""I still weigh 150. I work out every day. I have a gym at the house, and I am very healthy."" (Here are 14 reasons to love Simmons' Instagram feed.)"

bar … and the Rock should probably pay for drinks, as the actor otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson has been named the world's highest-paid male actor by Forbes. Thanks to 2015 earnings of $64.5 million (his largest payday ever), Johnson knocked Robert Downey Jr. off the pay pedestal, helped along by upfront compensation from blockbusters such as this year's Central Intelligence and next year's Fast 8. Chan followed close behind on the Forbes list with $61 million, while Damon came in third with $55 million, boosted mainly by The Martian. Here, the top five and their 2015 earnings: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, $64.5 million Jackie Chan, $61 million, Matt Damon, $55 million Tom Cruise, $53 million Johnny Depp, $48 million Forbes ranked actresses as well, with Jennifer Lawrence earning the No. 1 spot with $46 million, followed by Melissa McCarthy at $33 million and Scarlett Johansson at $25 million. The magazine notes that comparing the two sets of earnings underscores the gender pay gap that still exists, with top-earning Lawrence earning just 71% of Johnson's pay. The top 5 women actors and their 2015 earnings: Jennifer Lawrence, $46 million Melissa McCarthy, $33 million Scarlett Johansson, $25 million Jennifer Aniston, $21 million Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, $17 million Check out the top breadwinners in both the men's and women's categories."

Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers first revealed his flat-Earth beliefs back in February, and now retired basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has revealed he's on the same page. In an episode of his podcast broadcast late February but only recently picked up by the media, Shaq said, per Sports Illustrated: ""It’s true. The Earth is flat. The Earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind—what you read, what you see, and what you hear."" He used an example involving Christopher Columbus, arguing that Columbus didn't really discover America because there were already ""fair-skinned people"" living here when Columbus arrived. Then he got into the real nitty gritty. He explained that he drives from coast to coast, and it certainly seems flat to him: ""I’m just saying. I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it’s flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? You mean to tell me that China is under us? China is under us? It’s not. The world is flat."" Kenny Ducey at SI says that while he wants to believe this is all a joke, both Irving and O'Neal seem to be taking it seriously; Irving, for example, has continued to defend his beliefs. Ben Rohrbach at Yahoo Sports, who first uncovered the Shaq podcast, agrees that Irving is not kidding around (or trying to make some sort of point about ""fake news,"" as NBA commissioner Adam Silver suggested), and points out that at least two other NBA players have agreed with him."

But when 30 guests watched Miriam Reeves escorted down the aisle by her beaming father Saturday, few could hold back their tears. Just a month earlier, Miriam, 31, decided to move her traditional church wedding in Michigan to the garden at the Foundation Park Alzheimer's Care Center in Toledo, Ohio, where her father, Bernard Reeves, 64, has been a resident since his Alzheimer's symptoms got worse two years ago. She had been worried he'd wander off if he had to leave the center to attend a wedding elsewhere. ""My dad has been my hero my entire life and I know that if he was well, he would be at my wedding front and center,"" Miriam tells the Toledo Blade. ""And I thought, 'Why not move it there and it would be more of a special event.'"" The staff was enthusiastic, she says, adding that she believes her wedding was the first to be held at the center. Her father served in the Army during the Vietnam War, then became a police chaplain, and was also a pastor in Detroit, reports the AP. He is now in an advanced stage of the disease, but he still recognizes his daughter. (Also over the weekend, a New York cop got to see the baby he saved 20 years ago get married.)"

He admitted that he found the Pardoning of the National Turkey ""a little puzzling,"" but said ""with all the tough stuff that swirls around in this office it's nice once in a while just to say, 'Happy Thanksgiving,'"" CNN reports. The White House held an online campaign this year where users could tweet in favor of saving Mac or Cheese, Politico reports. Cheese won, but Obama said both would be spared ""a terrible and delicious fate."" ""I know some will call this amnesty, but don't worry, there’s plenty of turkey to go around,"" Obama joked. This is the sixth turkey pardon of Obama's presidency and the novelty definitely appears to have worn off for Malia and Sasha. The girls, now 16 and 13, looked on with ""barely contained disdain,"" and Malia said, ""Nah"" when her father asked her if she'd like to pet Cheese, Gawker reports (it shares a gif of their ""teen face""). The daughters aren't the only ones with disdain for the tradition. Critics call it a mockery of real presidential pardons and note that the birds don't tend to spend long, peaceful retirements on farms: They're not bred to live long and most end up dead within a few months of the ""pardon."""

agreed to let Arab League observers into the country, but it's not about to do the same with Arab troops. Responding angrily to the emir of Qatar's suggestion that troops intervene, Syria's foreign ministry made clear it won't stand idly by if foreign soldiers move in, reports AP. ""The Syrian people reject any foreign intervention in its affairs, under any title, and would confront any attempt to infringe upon Syria's sovereignty and the integrity of its territories,"" said a statement. Syrian officials were reportedly ""shocked"" at the proposal and warned it could ""kill the chances of Syria working closely with Arabs,"" according to al-Jazeera. As for the Arab League's observer mission, it's expected to wrap up this week by announcing that Syria has failed to put a League-brokered peace plan into place. The mission is widely seen as a failure, with at least 400 people killed since the first observers deployed in late December."

The Texas Nationalist Movement is unhappy with both Democrats and Republicans, and is especially concerned with the growing national debt and rising taxes, reports the AP via the Houston Chronicle. ""Texas can take better care of itself than Washington,"" says the group’s VP. ""We are here to raise interest in the Legislature of the possibility of secession to cure the ills of America."" The small but passionate group want state lawmakers to allow Texans to vote on whether or not to declare independence. ""The only way is to secede and wipe the slate clean,"" says a radio show host. ""We secede, and then we reform this government based on an absolute return back to basic principles."" Adds the group’s membership director, “This is a cake that’s been baking for 85 years.” The demonstrators are no fans of Gov. Rick Perry; one calls him “a big government fraud who claims to be conservative.” Mother Jones notes that State Rep. Leo Berman, a birther, sponsored the rally."

comment pending litigation,"– A Michigan convict who won accolades for his book of short stories may be forced to give up all he earned from his book deal. Curtis Dawkins' debut, The Graybar Hotel, was published in July by Scribner and details life behind bars in ways that have thrilled readers. Michigan's Department of Treasury is less enthused, however, and has filed a court complaint that asks that 90% of the convicted killer's reported $150,000 advance be given to the state as payment for the cost of his imprisonment. Michigan's attorney general reportedly filed the complaint, which states that Dawkins is not entitled to the money or to transfer any of it to his family, not long after his victim's brother complained publicly about the book deal, per the Guardian. Because he cannot afford an attorney, Dawkins is scheduled to defend himself in the case. Dawkins has in the past expressed remorse for the 2004 botched robbery that led to the murder of Thomas Bowman. The New York Times reports he intends to argue that the same law the attorney general says allows the state to keep the profits also stipulates that courts must consider a convict's obligation to provide for his children or spouse when deciding such cases. Michigan is one of some 40 states with laws on the books that allow the government to force inmates to pay for incarceration. According to the Times, Michigan collected $3.7 million from fewer than 300 of the state's 40,000 inmates. A hearing in Dawkins' case is scheduled for Feb. 26 in Kalamazoo."

also immortalized in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side,"" died Sunday at age 69 after battling cancer, the AP reports. Born in Puerto Rico, her mother moved Holly—who was, at that point, Harold—to New York and then Miami Beach, the New York Times reports. Woodlawn hitchhiked back to New York at 16, where she was a go-go dancer, among other things: ""I was turning tricks, living off the streets and wondering when my next meal was coming,"" she wrote in her 1991 memoir. While performing in a friend's musical in 1969, Woodlawn told a journalist that she was one of Warhol's superstars, and though that wasn't actually true at that point, her comment got his attention and led to what the Times refers to as Woodlawn's ""underground stardom."" Warhol's filmmaking partner Paul Morrissey cast her in the 1970 film Trash as the girlfriend of a heroin addict, and the performance got good reviews. She went on to star alongside two other transgender actresses in Morrissey's 1971 film Women in Revolt; both films were produced by Warhol. In 1972, Reed wrote the first lines of his now-classic song about Woodlawn at Warhol's suggestion, the Washington Post reports: ""Holly came from Miami F-L-A / Hitchhiked her way across the USA / Plucked her eyebrows on the way / Shaved her legs and then he was a she / She says, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side.'"" She went on to do a few more films and perform as a cabaret artist, but by the end of the 1970s she was working at a Benihana in Miami. She moved to California in the 1990s, where she studied fashion design and had a few more roles, most recently in Amazon's Transparent. (Click to read about 24 transgender historical figures.)"

""She is getting paid to date rich men,"" and mother ""Dina is pimping her out,"" he says. Other ""insiders"" back him up, including one who says that the days-long ""dates"" include LiLo's hotel and travel costs, food, jewelry, and ""other gifts."" But no sex—or at least, not that anyone is saying. She's supposedly been paid to be seen on the arm of a Southeast Asian prince and a rich Spanish-American painter. It's far from the only troubling LiLo story bubbling up: A source also tells Us that last fall, Lindsay did $50,000 worth of damage to a fancy New York hotel room. ""Her suite had so many cigarette burns, they had to change all the carpets,"" the insider says. ""She is not allowed back at any W hotel in NYC, ever!"" And then, of course, there are Lohan's legal problems. She could still be facing jail time for allegedly lying to police after her June car accident, but her longtime attorney Shawn Holley planned to make a plea deal involving rehab for Lindsay instead. But Lohan fired Holley as the attorney was on her way to court to make the deal Monday, TMZ reports. Even so, Holley entered a not-guilty plea on Lohan's behalf yesterday, and the Atlantic Wire notes that the next hearing is set for Jan. 30."

this says but findings undermine lying still feetintheair advice given many women trying conceive says macklon read more when get pregnant computer knows age start trying,"– Good news for those trying to conceive: A new study suggests there's no reason for you to continue lying down, immobile, after having sex. There's a widespread belief that lying still after sex helps give the sperm time to get where they need to go, and the same belief has transferred over to women getting intra-uterine insemination (IUI), a fertility treatment in which sperm are injected directly into the uterus. ""There’s a lot of anxiety that after IUI if you stand up, everything will fall out,"" an expert from the University of Southampton tells New Scientist. Two studies have found that resting in bed for 15 minutes after getting IUI did increase success rates, but they were small studies. The new, larger study out of Amsterdam's VU University Medical Center disputes that belief. Researchers looked at 479 women getting IUI, most of whom got multiple rounds; they collected information on nearly 2,000 cycles overall. Women were randomly assigned to either get up and move immediately after treatment or stay on bed rest for 15 minutes before moving. Of the cycles incorporating bed rest, 32% resulted in pregnancy—while 40% of the cycles after which the women immediately moved resulted in pregnancy. ""In our opinion,"" says the lead researcher in a press release, ""immobilization after IUI has no positive effect on pregnancy rates, and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilized after treatment."" She would not ""generalize"" the results to give advice to couples attempting to get pregnant via traditional intercourse, but the Southampton expert thinks the study likely applies there, too. (This woman became pregnant after her doctor said she couldn't, and now she's suing.)"

The president took to Twitter Saturday morning to express his displeasure and to suggest that Cohen might have broken the law. The FBI seized the recording during its raid on Cohen's office earlier this year, but the tape only came to light this week. On Saturday, Trump reiterated he wasn't happy about that April raid, either. ""Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,"" he wrote. ""Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!"" The tape is of a phone conversation Cohen had with Trump shortly before the election in which they discuss a possible payment regarding former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal, who planned to go public with allegations of an affair. Presidential attorney Rudy Guiliani has heard the tape, and he says it is not legally damaging to Trump. Plus, no payment was ever made, he says.

The 20-year-old climbed into the tank of an outdoor toilet Friday after his friend dropped his cellphone into it, AFP reports. According to VG, the friends decided Larsen was the only one skinny enough to get into the toilet and retrieve the phone. ""Slim enough to get into it, but not slim enough to get out,"" Larsen clarifies. He found himself standing thigh-deep in excrement—the toilet is only emptied once per year—and unable to climb out. Larsen was, understandably, vomiting; in addition to the human waste, he says there were animals crawling on him. After an hour of Larsen trying to escape the poo-poo prison, his friends called the local fire department. Firefighters quickly cut Larsen out of the toilet using a chainsaw. A spokesperson for the department notes ""it was pretty full down there."" Larsen was disinfected and treated for bruising on his arms, and he also says he received some animal bites, per the Sun. ""It was disgusting as hell. The worst thing I have ever experienced,"" Larsen tells VG. ""I will never enter a toilet again."" And he didn't even get the phone, according to AFP. (That classic summertime pool smell? It's pee.)"

The city's lawyers have subpoenaed several high-profile pastors opposed to the law, seeking, among other things, ""all speeches, presentations, or sermons"" related to the law, homosexuality, and openly gay Mayor Annise Parker, reports the Houston Chronicle. The law's opponents are suing the city, claiming that it was wrong to determine that an effort to force a repeal referendum didn't gather enough signatures. Plaintiffs call the move ""harassment"" and a violation of First Amendment rights. ""For a city government to step into churches and ask pastors to turn in sermons, it's gone too far. This is not what America, the nation is about,"" one pastor who received a subpoena tells KTRK. But a city attorney says that since some of the signatures on the repeal petition were gathered at churches, the sermons are part of the case. ""If they choose to do this inside the church, choose to do this from the pulpit, then they open the door to the questions being asked,"" he says."

""adventure seeker"" and ""strong-willed man"" by friends died Wednesday in the Chesapeake Bay while paddleboarding, NPR and the Washington Post report. Cody Iorns, 25, pushed off land near Annapolis, Md., around 6pm Wednesday with three other paddlers, but rough conditions—including 5-foot-waves and 25mph wind gusts—soon caused Iorns to fall behind his friends. ""They all of a sudden looked back and noticed that Cody had fallen from his paddleboard and was face down in the water,"" Candy Thomson, a rep for the Maryland Natural Resources Police, tells NPR. The others pulled Iorns, whose life jacket hadn't inflated, back onto his board and administered CPR, which medics took over when they arrived on the scene, but it was too late. Iorns was pronounced dead at Anne Arundel Medical Center; the state medical examiner said the cause of death was accidental drowning. The Capital Gazette notes Iorns' death brings the number of boat-related fatalities so far for 2018 to 10; last year by this time there had only been four. ""We're on pace for one of the deadliest years boating-wise in Maryland,"" says MNRP Capt. Brian Rathgeb. The Annapolis paddleboard community, meanwhile, is mourning the loss of Iorns, a former Army medic who lost his arms after a 2015 motorcycle accident but had become an inspiration in the stand-up paddleboard community. His story had just been featured by National Geographic last year. ""He was our brother,"" paddleboard company Capital SUP Annapolis posted on Facebook. ""He was an inspiration to everyone on and off the water."""

said read share story httpusatlyudpmvm,"– A controversial new paper may shed light on Gulf War syndrome, a collection of symptoms seen in veterans of the 1991 conflict: Chemical weapons could be to blame. The researchers assert that when US troops bombed chemical weapons depots in Iraq, the neurotoxin sarin was sent into the atmosphere then carried by the wind all the way to American encampments 300 miles to the south. From there, weather conditions may have driven the toxin downward, potentially exposing troops to it for several days. Troops were told that chemical weapons alarms that blared at the time were false alarms, the New York Times reports. The theory has been raised before; the new paper supports it using intelligence and weather reports. The researchers also noted a correlation between the number of times troops say they heard the alarm and the severity of their symptoms. Satellite images in the report show yellow gas over the US encampments, USA Today adds. Almost half of 700,000 Gulf War veterans have made claims for disability, with many citing symptoms whose cause remains mysterious. The Pentagon has maintained that the gas couldn't have traveled far enough to present a threat, and other experts have agreed."

""We are talking about 700-year-old latrines. And yes, they still smell bad,"" an archaeologist explains. The team stumbled on what appears to be a 14th-century communal toilet area in the medieval town of Odense, unearthing a number of medieval barrels filled with human waste. And in case you were wondering, the poop the barrels contained was in ""excellent condition,"" reports Discovery News, with the Copenhagen Post explaining that its ""putrid odor"" hadn't diminished over the centuries. But it's more than just stinky. It actually tells researchers a lot about how the people of the time lived. (LiveScience notes latrine samples from roughly the same period in Cyprus revealed the intestinal parasites that plagued the crusaders there.) ""Preliminary results of analysis show that raspberries were popular in Odense in the 1300s,"" the head archaeologist reveals.

website less third company female 37 staff minority employees whether oracle includes asians minority employees category unclear oracles diversity website makes mention compensation parity,"– Oracle provides contracting services for the feds via its cloud computing software, resulting in ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in government contracts, per a Labor Department release. That means the tech company has to adhere to federal nondiscriminatory hiring practices, which a DOL lawsuit announced Wednesday says has not been the case, CNN reports. The complaint alleges Oracle has, in a ""systemic practice,"" extended higher paychecks to white males over female, African-American, and Asian workers with the same job title. On the flip side, the company is also accused of having a bias toward Asian workers (specifically, Asian Indians, per BuzzFeed), with ""targeted recruitment"" and ""referral bonuses"" coaxing ""its heavily Asian workforce to recruit other Asians."" The DOL has been trying to address complaints of a lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, and it has filed suit in recent months against other federal contractors, including Google to turn over compensation data, data software firm Palantir for discriminating against Asian applicants, and JPMorgan Chase for gender discrimination in a complaint also filed Wednesday, per Reuters. But here's where the politics supposedly come into play, which is what Oracle claims is the underlying impetus: Oracle CEO Safra Catz and Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir, are both members of President-elect Trump's transition team, with Catz saying last month she would ""tell the president-elect that we are with him and will help in any way we can."" An Oracle spokeswoman calls the suit ""politically motivated"" and ""wholly without merit."""

well move that alexandra berzon contributed article write jennifer levitz jenniferlevitzwsjcom,"– The Tea Party proved itself to be a major force in yesterday's elections, but a force for what has yet to be determined. ""No one in this movement is stopping today. This is not an endgame. This is just a beginning,"" a leader of the Tea Party patriots told the Wall Street Journal as candidates backed by the movement swept to victory in Florida and Kentucky. In Delaware and Nevada, however, the fears of the GOP establishment were realized as Tea Party-backed candidates were defeated in races the Republicans had expected to win easily. Exit polls found that 40% of voters supported the movement, though there was little agreement on which specifics of the Tea Party agenda they backed. Many who considered themselves Tea Party supporters backed compromising with the Democrats to some degree, though activists say they have no intention of compromising even with the GOP establishment. “If Republican leaders think for a minute that they’re going to suck us in and continue business as usual, they’re wrong,"" a Tea Party activist who ran Rand Paul's primary campaign in Kentucky told the New York Times."

counties in the US are now home to ticks that carry Lyme disease, including areas where they'd never before been documented, researchers at the CDC report in the Journal of Medical Entomology. That's up from 30% of counties in 1998, with the Guardian reporting that the number of Lyme disease incidents has tripled in the US since the '90s. The biggest increases were seen in northern and northeastern states, reports CBS News, which singles out Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin. It's not surprising, then, that while some 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported annually, the real figure is estimated at a staggering 330,000 people every year. While Lyme disease continues to be fairly easy to treat via antibiotics, if left untreated it can lead to serious symptoms, including chronic joint inflammation and even heart and neurological problems years after infection, reports the CDC, which adds that the best preventive measures are removing ticks as quickly as possible and applying pesticides. Biologists blame reforestation, growing deer populations, and climate change for the fast spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease, reports the Guardian, and the researchers note in a press release the rise of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in particular. (Warmer autumns allow ticks more time to feed and infest.)"

It's a directive President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe most definitely did not follow while the two visited the Akasaka palace's koi carp pond Monday. The Guardian reports that the men began by spooning a bit of food in before ""appearing to lose patience"" and essentially dumping the contents of the boxes they held into the pond. While some in the media were quick to pounce on Trump for the apparent gaffe, the Guardian notes that video footage shows he was simply imitating Abe's approach."

tweet location you add location information tweets city precise location web via thirdparty applications you always option delete tweet location history learn,"– A racist joke on Twitter has cost Roseanne Barr her show. ABC on Tuesday canceled the reboot of Roseanne amid a storm of criticism directed at its star, reports CNN. The move came after Barr apologized not once but twice on Tuesday for a jarring insult directed at former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. In a since-deleted tweet, Barr wrote, ""muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."" As the post began getting traction Tuesday, Barr took to Twitter again. ""I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter,"" she wrote. And then came a lengthier mea culpa: ""I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste."" Related coverage: ABC: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,"" says the network's statement, per USA Today. Jarrett: Now a senior fellow at the University of Chicago Law School, she declined to comment through a spokesperson, reports Politico. Jarrett is black, and she was born in Iran to American parents. Sykes bailed: Before ABC's move, African-American comedian Wanda Sykes, credited as a consulting producer on Roseanne, tweeted that she would not be returning to the show, reports Entertainment Weekly. Sara Gilbert: The Roseanne star, who was instrumental in the show's reboot, also distanced herself early. The comments ""are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show,"" she tweeted. ""I am disappointed in her actions to say the least."""

That they did so in their local supermarket is why it's making headlines. Scientists in London picked up a packet of dried porcini mushrooms at the grocery store and then used a technique known as DNA barcoding, explains the CBC. When they attempted to match the DNA profiles of the dried mushrooms to known species, they discovered that three of the 15 pieces they tested were previously unknown to science. Introducing Boletus meiweiniuganjun, Boletus bainiugan, and Boletus shiyong. All come from China, as do about half the porcini mushrooms sold in Europe, reports Science 2.0. It's not so much a bombshell discovery as evidence of the ""enormously diverse and completely under-documented"" world of fungi, says the blog post. These particular porcinis have likely been consumed for decades; it's just that nobody had taken the time to categorize them. That said, the researchers were surprised to get hits on three of only 15 specimens, notes Kew.org. The new research is published in the journal PeerJ. (Scientists still can't figure out what these mushroom-like creatures are in the deep sea.)"

actions brought teammates friends even closer together before accident friends steve smith said now were actually brothers its overwhelming,"– Two Virginia teens are suddenly more than just baseball teammates after a near-death experience during a practice July 14, NBC Washington reports. Steve Smith was running the bases when a throw from the catcher inadvertently nailed him under his left armpit, causing cardiac arrest. “His heart stopped immediately,"" his father and coach, Tim Smith, tells ABC News. ""When I got to him he was stiff, like his body was trying to breathe but his eyes were rolled back in his head."" Teammate Paul Dow started performing CPR, a skill he had recently learned during lifeguard training. Dow tells NBC that performing CPR on Smith “felt like I was having a spiritual conversation with him.” Twelve minutes after Dow started CPR, medics arrived and used a defibrillator to restart Smith's heart. Smith was unconscious for a few days but woke up July 17 feeling fine. Tim Smith credits Dow for preventing his son from suffering brain damage and probably saving his life. “It’s a miracle,” he tells ABC. Dow says God helped him save his teammate. “There is no way in heck I did that by myself,” he tells Fox 5. Smith says he likely wouldn't be alive if it weren't for Dow. ""Before the accident, we were friends,"" he tells NBC. ""Now, we're actually brothers.”"

sanjay gupta every tuesday cnn health team treatment focuses alleviating symptoms read more,"– A rare condition known for its polio-like effects has been diagnosed in six Minnesota children since mid-September. Per CNN, the condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and damages the body's nervous system. While uncommon, AFM is serious and can lead to paralysis or even death. The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the Star-Tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, AFM's more elusive cause means there is no vaccine. ""Disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Health said in a statement. ""The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information."" AFM most commonly affects young children and the cases in Minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. AFM is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of AFM, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren't permanent. (Meanwhile, the CDC says the disease may be on the rise.)"
